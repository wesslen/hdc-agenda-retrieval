APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI 2020-00464, 1515 WILMORE DRIVE (PID: 11908222) – CHIMNEY REMOVAL 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing building is a 1.5 story front gable Bungalow constructed in 1946. Architectural features include a partial width front porch that wraps around the left elevation supported by brick piers and wood columns, brackets, and a substantial chimney on the right elevation. There is a smaller flue chimney on the left elevation and another toward the rear of the right elevation. The siding and trim on the main body of the house is wrapped in vinyl. 

PROPOSAL :

Habitat for Humanity of the Charlotte Region is completing a Critical Home Repair project at 1515 Wilmore Dr to improve the health and safety of the home. The only portion of the project that requires full Commission review is the request to removal all three (3) chimneys to below the level of roof deck. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The chimney at the front right appears to be a primary, contributing element to the character of the historic building. 

2. The chimney on the left elevation appears to be a secondary flue as does the chimney to the rear of the right elevation. Due to the secondary, less prominent design and locations of these chimneys, they are eligible for staff review. 

3. The other proposed projects in the included scope of work are all reviewable at the staff level or are considered routine maintenance and do not require review/approval. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Mr. Henningson’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: APPROVED 1 st : HINDMAN 2 nd : HADEN

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI 2020-00388, 405 HEATHCLIFF STREET (PID: 07103301) – ADDITION/ACCESSORY STRUCTURE 

This application was continued from the October 14, 2020 meeting for the following items: 

• Page 3.22: Front porch 

o Front door and porch addition to be restudied to be in keeping with the American Small House style. 

o Front porch floor should be tongue and groove flooring versus decking. 

• Section 7.2: Rear addition should also be in keeping with the American Small House style, including: 

o Windows to be mulled together. Deny any use of Eze-Breeze product on this application with windows to be approved by staff. 

o Rear addition should read as an enclosed porch with column and beam details on the corners. 

o Enclosed soffit versus an open soffit. 

o Left elevation addition wall should be offset from the existing house wall by 6 to 12 inches. 

• Pages 6.9 and 4.4: Masonry foundation should be underneath the rear addition versus open air. 

• Fence: The main fence line on the left elevation in the front yard to stay the same, in the same location. 

• Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) in the rear of the yard: Offset the shed dormer on the rear elevation on the ADU at least 12 inches from the wall below it on the main floor. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a one-story, American Small House constructed c. 1958. According to the Wesley Heights National Register Nomination, the house was moved to this lot in 1994. The house is wrapped in vinyl siding and had vinyl 1/1 replacement windows. It is unclear if the front stoop is original. Based on the design, size and scale of the porch supports, these appear to be later additions. There are very few original distinguishable architectural features on this house, which may or may not be present under the vinyl siding. Lot size is 63’ x 150’. Surrounding structures are 1 and 1.5 story single family buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project has multiple elements, including: 

1. Front portico design change. 

2. Rear addition of heated space that ties below the original ridge. 

3. Remove the vinyl siding and replace any original siding with new Hardie siding. Replacement window and door trim is also proposed. 

4. Construction of a new garage with living space above at the rear of the lot. Footprint is approximately 23’-0” x 32’-0’ and height is 22’-6” as measured from grade to ridge but sits below the house due to lot topography. 

Revised Proposal 

1. Front porch: Wood piers changed to brick. Flooring changed to tongue and groove. 

2. Rear addition: window and trim changes. 

3. Foundation changed to brick piers with wood screening. 

4. ADU: Rear dormer stepped-in on sides. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Front Elevation: 

a. Replacement front door – dentil molding is incongruous for the architecture of this house. 5

b. Porch flooring is tongue and groove – confirm will be installed perpendicular to the front door. 

c. Design of front porch is incongruous with the architecture of the house, including the brackets, exposed rafter tails, and the front porch posts. Full length square wood columns would be more appropriate to the house. 

2. Windows 

a. Mullion trim needed between ganged windows. 

3. Accessory Building 

a. Dormer is co-planer to the first level on the left and right elevations. 

4. Minor changes may be approved by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS 1 st : HINDMAN 2 nd : HADEN 

Ms. Hindman moved to approve this application with the following conditions: the rear addition columns are not necessary and can be removed at the discretion of the applicant. The foundation as shown is approved per federal guideline number 9 and the accessory dwelling unit dormer needs to be offset at least 12 inches from the wall below on all three sides, to be reviewed by staff.

PROPOSAL: 

• The proposal is the installation of an ADA-compliant access ramp along the right (Ewing) elevation. 

• The ramp proposed will be constructed with a wood structure and either wood or synthetic deck (horizontal surface only). The wood will be painted, and the guard rail will be a black powder coated aluminum (see the drawings) with black powder coated steel handrail. 6

• Landscaping will be installed between the end of the ramp and the parking area to help screen the two air conditioning condensing units and to approve the appearance of the Ewing elevation. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION

HDCRMI 2020-00621, 2007 DILWORTH ROAD E. (PID: 12111108) - ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

Known as the Hutchinson House, the one-story Colonial Revival house was constructed in 1925. Architectural features include a shed roof one-bay portico supported by paired columns, a one-story hip roof side wing, wood shutters, fan light over the front door, and 6/1 double-hung wood windows. Except for the foundation, the house is painted brick. Existing ridge height is 21’-9”. The lot size is approximately 60’ x 144’. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is a rear addition and deck addition. A much larger project included raising the main ridge, adding a front dormer and changing the historic front portico was approved in January 15, 2020 HDC meeting under case number HDCRMI 2019-00617. Given the significant reduction in the project scope, with no changes to the front elevation, the project is a recommended consent agenda item. The rear addition is slightly taller than the original ridge line, which is why the project cannot be reviewed at the Administrative level. New windows will be either double-hung or casement with Simulated True Divided Lights (STDL) in a 6/1 pattern to match existing. Proposed materials of the additions are wood lap siding and trim to match existing. No changes to the rear yard impermeable area. There are no impacts to mature canopy trees. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION 

1. The proposal is not incongruous with the District and meets the guidelines for Additions, 7.2. 7

2. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, staff recommends Approval of the addition for meeting all Guidelines and that this item be heard as a Consent Agenda item, with permit-ready construction drawings submitted to staff for final review. 

3. If requested by a Commission member, or if an interested party has signed up to speak in opposition, then the HDC shall open the application for a full hearing.

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

Known as the Carter House, the 1.5-story Craftsman bungalow was constructed in 1925. Architectural features include a front gabled ell anchored by a front exterior brick chimney, side-gabled roof with deep eaves supported by triangular knee braces. Siding material is asbestos with an unpainted brick foundation, and windows are 6/1 double-hung wood. The house height is approximately 24’-1” as measured from grade to ridge. The lot size is approximately 55’ x 197.5’. Adjacent structures are 1, 1.5, and 2-story residential buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is the addition of a dormer on the front elevation and a rear addition of heated square footage and a covered porch. The rear addition ties in below the main ridge and steps in 4 ¼” on both the right and left elevations. The footprint of the rear addition is approximately 11’-7 1/2” deep x 30’ wide. The covered porch addition is approximately 16’-0” deep x 29’-8 ½” wide. All materials and details are proposed to match existing except for the siding. The house is currently covered with asbestos shingle siding. The new addition will have wood lap siding. The rear addition measures approximately 21’-3” from grade to ridge. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Front Dormer: 

a. Location. Dormer does not appear to be quite centered above the paired windows on the first level and also appears to tie in at the main ridge, not 6” beneath. 

b. Divided light proportions of windows in dormer and missing mullion trim detail. 

2. Rear Addition + Porch Addition 

a. The site topography appears to slope upward from the front of the site toward the back of the site. Will the rear ridge line be visible above the main ridge due to site topography? 

3. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 9

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI 2020-00632, 330 SETTLERS LANE (PID: 07803706) - ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a brick townhome constructed in 1988. The building is an end unit in a row of three townhomes and both end units are mirror images of each other. Siding material is unpainted brick. Adjacent structures are two and three-story brick townhomes. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is to change the hip roof above the triple window on the front elevation to a flat roof with a terrace. The building is experiencing water infiltration issues. A window on the front elevation will be changed to a door to access the new rooftop terrace. Materials are metal railing and Duratek flooring to match other townhome units along Settlers Lane. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The Commission has approved the use of alternative deck materials on horizontal surfaces in certain instances previously. Typically, on non-original rear decks on interior lots. 

2. The location of the terrace, on a second level, may allow for the use of alternative materials on the horizontal surfaces due to the minimal visibility of the terrace floor from the street. 

3. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff.

Mr. Christopher Haering spoke in favor of the project. 10 

Mr. Christopher Muryn spoke in favor of the project. 

MOTION: CONTINUED 1 st : RUMSCH 2 nd : HADEN 

Mr. Rumsch moved to continue for more detail on how the addition will be built and the exact materials that are going to be used to either flash it or service it. We're good with the concept of a roof being replaced instead of a hip roof on the corner of the building, but we need for a detailed section through the roof showing how the flashing is done with the wall below. A correct relationship between the top of the deck and the interior floor elevation, and some documentation of the system that is going down.
