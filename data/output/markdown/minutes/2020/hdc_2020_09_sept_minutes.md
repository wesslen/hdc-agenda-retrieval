HDCRMI 2020-00264, 333 W. 9 th STREET– ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing building 2-story Victorian constructed c. 1910. The building has very few distinctive architectural features besides the front door and trim, and what it once had has either been replaced (ex. the original 2/2 windows) or covered up (ex. the original wood siding and trim band between the siding and the gables). Adjacent structures are 1.5 and 2-story single-family and commercial buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal includes two porch additions and material changes. On the front elevation a second level porch is proposed. An existing window opening will also be changed to a door to access the porch. On the rear elevation, an inset area will be filled in with a two-story porch. The project also includes removal of the aluminum siding and trim and replacement with new beveled wood siding and trim, except for the gables on all four elevations in which fish scale wood shingles are proposed. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Front Elevation Porch Changes 

1. This is a simple vernacular Victorian. A second level front porch as proposed is incongruous with both the architecture of the original house and of Victorian architecture in general. In addition, there does not appear to be any other examples of this type of second level front porch in the Fourth Ward historic district. 

2. Applicable Secretary of the Interiors Standards: #1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9 and 10. 

2. Rear Elevation Porch Changes 

3. No concerns. This portion of the project appears to be not incongruous with the house or the Fourth Ward district. 

3. Siding/Trim Changes • This is a simple vernacular Victorian. Incorporation of high-style element such as the fish-scale siding in the gables is incongruous with the architecture of the original house and the other similar Victorian structures within the Fourth Ward District (ex: 529 N. Poplar Street). 

• Removal of the metal siding is encouraged; however, the original wood siding should be retained and repaired, rather than replaced. 

• Applicable Secretary of the Interiors Standards: #1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9 and 10.

APPLICATION: 

HDCCMI 2020-00324, 1513, 1515, 1521 S. MINT STREET – COMMERCIAL BUILDING REHABILITATION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing properties are connected brick Industrial/Commercial buildings. 1513 was constructed c. 1927 and 1515 was constructed c. 1946. 1513 is a three-bay building. Material is brick running bond (painted) with a parapet roof with decorative solider course brick at the roofline and above the storefront openings. Most of the original storefront openings have been infilled over the years with a combination of glass block and wood paneling. The transom windows over the left and center bays appear to retain the original metal windows framed in wood trim. The three signage spaces appear to be later additions. The rear third of the building appears to be a later addition. The lot size is approximately 50’ x 150’. 

1515 is four-bay building with smaller storefront windows, recessed front entry, and a garage bay. Material is brick common bond, painted. A solider course of inset brick runs the length of the building above the windows and doors giving the storefront a modified tripartite design. The top third of the building has inset header bricks that form a rectangle across all four bays, likely originally intended as an area for signage. The lot size is approximately 50’ x 150’. 

1521 is a vacant gravel lot used for parking. Adjacent structures are commercial buildings, parking lots and single family residential to the rear along Westwood Avenue and Wickford Place. 

On September 11, 2019, the Commission approved fenestration changes, existing windows storefronts and doors, painted brick, restoration of historic transom windows, parking area improvements, and the demolition of a non-historic rear addition at 1513 S. Mint. The approval did not include signage, murals, awnings, or lighting. 

PROPOSAL: 

1513 S. Mint Street 

• Rear Addition. A cle res tory addition of 3’-2” will be added to the rear portion of the building to 

allow for natural light and proper roof drainage at the addition. The height is no higher than 

the top of the adjacent building’s barrel roof. 

• Lighting. 

• No changes to front elevation. 

1515 S. Mint Street 

• East Elevation – storefront window and door changes. 

• No change to front elevation. 

• South Elevation – new door and canopy removed.

Show side by side of what your changing, what is there today and what you propose. Mr. Haden made a friendly amendment to have a comparison of what is original/existing, to what was originally approved, and what the applicant is asking for now in the way of fenestration changes, opening changes, and the cle re story.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI 2020-00312, 604 SUMMIT AVENUE– ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a one-story American Small House with colonial revival details constructed in 1937. Architectural features include a symmetrical three-bay façade with thin, paired columns supporting an arched portico, clipped gable ends, and 6/1 windows. Adjacent structures are a mix of one- and two-story residential buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

Currently, the front porch patio is only partial width located under the center portico and on the right of the portico. The project would expand the existing front porch patio to the left to span all three-bays of the house. The project also includes the addition of hip roofs supported by thin paired columns over both the left and right patio areas to create a full-width front porch. All materials and details are to be traditional in design and dimension to match existing. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The proposal is similar to a previously approved front porch additions at 318 Grandin Rd 

(November 2019), 429 West Blvd (May 2019), and 1910 Ewing Drive (2016). 

2. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI 2020-00277, 1106 E. WORTHINGTON AVENUE– ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a 1.5 story Tudor Revival brick cottage constructed c. 1930. Architectural features include an asymmetrical façade with a large chimney and pair of façade gables one of which contains an arched entry with keystones and the other a diamond pane window, steep-side gables with stucco accents, 6/1 double-hung wood windows, and a one-story rear ell. Lot size is approximately 60’ x 155’. Adjacent structures are a mix of one- and two-story residential buildings. A rear screen porch addition, window restoration, retaining wall and front walk repairs were approved at the staff level under COA# HDCADMRM-2020-00278. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is for a dormer addition, changing wood vents to windows in the gables on the left and right elevations, and window replacement. The proposed dormer is slightly taller than the side gable on right elevation but ties in beneath the main ridge of the house. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Dormer: 

a. Recommend ganged windows with mullion trim, instead of single windows to better fit the design of the house. Nearly all the windows on the house are paired with mullion trim. 

b. Roof pitch 

2. Vent Changes: Recommend diamond pane windows (either fixed or casement) to match the small similarly sized windows on the front elevation. 3. Replacement Windows: The issue appears to be with deteriorated trim elements (brick mould, etc.) rather than deteriorated window sashes.

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION 1 : APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS 1st : HINDMAN 2nd : RUMSCH
