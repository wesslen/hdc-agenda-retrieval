APPLICATION : HDCRMA 2019 -00748, 201 GRANDIN ROAD - ADDITION 

EXISTING CON DITIONS :3

The existing structure is a Romanesque Revival church designed by renowned Charlotte architect Louis Asbury and 

constructed in 1928. The “T” shaped building contains both sanctuary and offices. The Church section has a gable facing 

Grandin Road. Notable architectural features include the triple entry with marbled windows, brick with crenellations, 

pilasters and corbelling details, cast stone trim, and arched, marbled windows. The proper ty also includes a 1.5 story 

brick rectory constructed c. 1940. The rectory is an American Small House with Tudor and Colonial Revival details. 

Adjacent structures 1, 1.5 and 2 -story single family residential buildings and 2 -3-story multi -family townhomes. The lot 

size is approximately 108’ x 187.5’. The parcel is zoned MUDD(CD). 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is the conversion of a former church into condominiums. No changes are proposed to the front 

elevation. The only proposed change to the rear elevation is to add windows on the basement level in dimensions and 

configuration to match ex isting; proposed material is aluminum clad. On the right (courtyard) elevation the windows on 

the basement level will be changed to aluminum clad patio doors. A single -entry door will be removed and bricked in to 

match existing. The stained -glass windows will be removed, and the openings enlarged. The left (W. 4 th St) elevation 

also includes the removal of all stained -glass windows and enlarging the openings. Portions of the windows are 

proposed to be re -used in the entry doors. Brick steps and partitio n walls will provide access and separation between 

the units. An addition will be constructed on the courtyard side of the building behind the existing parsonage. 

Proposed materials are brick to match existing and aluminum clad Simulated True Divided L ight (STDL) windows and 

doors. 

STAF F RECOMMENDATION 

Staff has the following concerns with the proposal: 

1. Primary concern: loss of all original, character -defining stained -glass windows on both the left and right elevations. 

A design solution to keep at least one elevation largely intact would be more suitable. 

2. Left Elevation: 

a. Loss of original windows. C onsider a re -design that keeps the original windows. 

b. Single entry door is shown to remain on the Axon view but is removed in the elevations. If removed, w ill the 

cast concrete detail be replicated ?

3. Right Elevation: 

a. Unique solution to re -use stained gla ss windows in the entry doors. 

b. Brick partition wall design 

4. Addition: 

a. Label size (footprint and height dimensions) on plans. 

b. Wood railings appear incongruous with the structure. 

c. Label tree species and size on the site plan for both trees proposed for r emoval and new trees to be planted. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST] :

side yard, see attached minutes and letter. The NC Historic Preservation Office (HPO) is reviewing the project for tax 

credits. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION :

Staff has the following concerns with the proposal: 

1. Lot size constraints do not allow for a s ubstantive one -story rear addition .

2. The addition is clearly distinguished from the original house. 

3. Driveway + driveway gate orientation. 

4. Rear yard fence may be reviewed by staff. 

5. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST] :

No o ne accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION : APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS 1st : HINDMAN 2nd : PARATI 

Ms. Hindman moved to approve this application, because it meets the following, the porch restoration is appr oved. The 

addition is approved with staff to review the construction documents for details. The unusual site constraints require

Architectural features include an asymmetrical sloped gable entry, one -story side porch (now enclosed), and 6/6 double -

hung windows with a keystone header detail. The lot size is an irregular pie shape measuring 171 x 177 x 71 x 88. The 

former garage structure was approved for removal the Administrative level in 2015. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is a new one -story accessory buildi ng with a footprint of 24’ x 24’ and an overall height of 21.2’. A 

breezeway roof will connect the garage to a former rear addition on the primary structure. The lot currently has two 

curb cuts and driveway entrances, one off Dilworth Road East and one o ff Isleworth Avenue. Per zoning, the front yard 

faces Dilworth Road East. Proposed materials are brick to match the house, wood garage doors, wood or composite

existing. The project also includes the removal of concrete in the side yard adjacent to Dilworth Road East, rebuilding 

the berm and replanting grass. There are no impacts to mature canopy trees; ornamental trees may have to be remo ved 

to construct the garage. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION :

Staff has the following concerns with the proposal: 

1. The unique shape of the lot provides challenges for locating the garage to meet all HDC requirements. If the 

garage is pushed to the corner, it wi ll be partially located in the side yard. 

2. Replanting ornamental trees to screen the breezeway, and as a separation between the garage and the single -

family residential house at 1029 Isleworth. 

3. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST] :

No one accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION : CONTINUED 1st : HENNINGSON 2nd : RUMSCH 

Mr. Henningson moved to continue this application for a site plan that shows the neighbor on the Islew orth side to 

ensure that the garage is not forward of the neighbor’s house, per guideline 8. 9, #2. Because of the site constraints, 

consider moving the garage further back into the rear yard to avoid side yard parking .

Ms. Hindman made a friendly amendme nt to get rid of breezeway because its implicit to the motion and it does not tie 

to a guideline.

Known as the Gantt House, the main building is a 1 -story bungalow, with Craftsman and Colonial Revival elements, 

constructed c. 1926 according to the National Register listing. A portico and porch combination shields two of the three 

facade bays of this small frame dwelling. One story high, it has a hipped roof crossed by clipped gables on the sides. The

• Ro of pitches labeled 

• Revised elevation drawings include re -designed rear dormer 

• Beam -column detail provided 

Accessory Building 

• Windows to be repaired and revised project drawings to be submitted to staff for review. 

Revised Proposal – January 15, 2020 

• Fr ont dormer changed from 7/12 gable roof to a 2/12 shed roof. 

• Front dormer windows changed from two to three and increased in size. 

• Rear dormer window changed from single to paired. 

• Retaining wall removed. 

• Corner board trim dimensions provided. 

• Cedar shake dimensions and application method provided. 

• Windows noted to be double -hung. 

• Rear door trim casing design revised. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION :

Staff has the following concerns with the proposal: 

1. Massing, directional expression, h eight and foundation (items appear unchanged from the December proposal ).

a. Massing. The house on the right is not a Bungalow, it is a Colonial Revival house with a steeply pitched roof and 

a completely different type and style fr om the proposed new construction. 

b. Directional Expression. Bungalows are typically more rectangular than square, and as proposed, the directional 

expression is square. 

c. The floor level of the foundation and front porch do not align with the houses on the street. 

d. The level of the windows on first floor do not align with first floor windows on neighboring houses. While it is 

understood that the windows on the current house do not, the current house is being demolished; all new 

construction shall to be bu ilt in accordance with the guidelines and required to come into compliance. 

2. Front dormer changed from a 7/12 gable roof to a 2/12 shed roof, and a larger triple window was added. Dormers 

typically have windows proportionally smaller than the windows on the main portion of the house. 

3. Rear dormer – single windows changed to paired windows. The paired windows in the dormer are larger than the 

paired windows on the first level. Dormers typically have windows proportionally smaller than the windows on the 

main portion of the house. 

4. Roofs – front por ch roof, front dormer, and rear dormer roofs all have 2/12 pitches, which is incongruous with the 

Bungalow style architecture. 

a. Eave overhangs on dormer are too shallow and do not match the Bungal ow style. Shed roof dormers typically 

have exposed rafters and/or brackets. 

5. Cornices, trim, and eave materials and dimensions need to be noted (ex: soffit, window/door trim material) 

a. Will eaves be closed or open? 

b. V-groove soffit? 

c. Confirm no pork chop eaves. 

d. Window and door trim material need specified. 

6. Porches: 12 

a. Front railing height/relationship between rail height and windows. Historically, the top rail on a porch railing 

was approximately equal to the height of the window sills. While the booster rail concept is moving the in the 

right direction, the relationship between the rail and windows may need to be revisited. Or additional 

information about the dimensions might be needed to clarify how it will look when built. 

b. Design of rail down front ste ps. Due to the long expanse, at least one support post will be needed mid -way 

which is not indicated on the drawings. Recommended: Front porch handrail down front steps to be a simple 

metal rail that disappears and does not distract from the house. 

7. Doors and Windows: 

a. Fenestration on right elevation .

b. Window muntin size. 

c. Rear door casing appears to be to narrow.

APPLICATION : HDCADMRM 2019 -00564, 1913 THE PLAZA – ALTERNATE MATERIALS 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

Known as the Hutchinson House, the two -story American Four Square with colonial revival elements built c. 1930. 

Architectural features i nclude a partial width front porch with the center portion covered by a portico, original front 

door sidelights, and 6/1 paired windows. The carport and decorative moldings above the front door and first floor 

windows are later additions. The house is pa inted brick and has been since before the district was established. The lot 

size is approximately 66’ x 170’. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposal is for a non -traditional mechanized screen system on a rear porch. The system is proposed to be 

integrated with the beams and the columns. Other than the request for the mechanized screen system, the other 

changes to the rear porch meet t he requirements to be reviewed at the Administrative level. No changes to the rear 

yard impermeable area. There are no impacts to mature canopy trees. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION :

Staff has the following concerns with the proposal: 

1. The changes to the existi ng rear porch are approvable at the Administrative level. 

2. The screen system is a unique solution to a three -season room, which has not yet been evaluated by the 

Commission. 

3. Rather than integrating the system with the columns and the beam, which results in a visible track, a better 

solution would be to install the equipment on the interior of the beams and to the rear of the columns so as to 

not be visible from the exterior. If installed on the interior, the system is more easily reversible with a much 

lesser impact to the overall porch design and would be in accordance with applicable Secretary of the Interiors 

Standards 9 and 10. 

4. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST] :

No one accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak for or against this application. 17 

MOTION : APPROVED 1st : JORDAN 2nd : HINDMAN 

Mr. Jordan moved to approve this application because it meets the Secretary of Interior Standards for rehabilitation and 

guideline, page 2.5. 

Ms. Hindman add ed that this project is a new porch and not an old porch. We are not discussing modifying historic 

columns. This is a very thoughtful solution to preserving the character of the district. If this were an old porch, we would 

be having a totally different conv ersation.
