HDCRMI 2020-00442, 1142 BERKELEY AVENUE – ADDITION 

ABSENT | RECUSE | LEFT | RETURNED: 

ABSENT: JORDAN, RUMSCH, BONAPARTE 

RECUSE: BARTH 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing building is a two-story Colonial Revival brick building constructed in 1939. Architectural features include a symmetrical façade, a front gable on hip slate roof, a central portico supported by thin round classical columns, 6/6 and 8/8 double-hung wood windows with wood shutters and paired exterior brick chimneys. Lot size is approximately 80 x 160. Adjacent structures are single family buildings that range in size from one-story to two and one-half stories. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is to remove an existing rear portico and install a new larger patio roof. The new roof will be metal, same as the existing portico, and supported by round wood columns inspired by the design of the front portico columns. The design of the proposed patio incorporates architectural details (columns, beam, trim, etc.) of the house. Patio material is brick with a brick rowlock and brick steps to the rear yard. The covered patio measures approximately 23’-3” x 22’-11”. The project does not include any changes to existing window/door openings. One door will be replaced with a new full glass door in a design that coordinates with the windows, see right elevation. A new brick chimney and outdoor fireplace will also be constructed. Post-construction the rear yard will be approximately 40% impermeable. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 

1. The proposal is not incongruous with the District and meets the guidelines for Additions, 7.2 

2. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, staff recommends Approval of the rear porch addition for meeting all Guidelines and that this item be heard as a Consent Agenda item, with permit-ready construction drawings submitted to staff for final review. 

3. If requested by a Commission member, or if an interested party has signed up to speak in opposition, then the HDC shall open the application for a full hearing.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI 2020-00446, 2131 PARK ROAD – RESTORATION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing building is a one-story Craftsman bungalow construction in 1925. Architectural features include a side-gable roof with and engaged front porch and porte cochere, a small gable dormer and 6/1 and 4/1 double-hung wood windows. Lot size is approximately 50 x 180. Adjacent structures are 1, 1.5 and 2-story single and multi-family buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is to restore a portion of the original front porch. The 6/1 window on the front elevation will be re-located to the new exterior wall. The new handrail will be wood to match the existing handrail on the left elevation. All new siding, trim, and details will match existing historic material. The local district designation survey photo shows the porch was enclosed before the establishment of the Dilworth local historic district. Evidence of the original brick piers are visible on the front elevation foundation. The 1953 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map indicates the presence of a full-width front porch. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 

1. Based on the evidence provided, the project appears to be a true restoration of a portion of the front porch which is not incongruous with the District and meets the guidelines for Porches, 4.8 #1, 2, and 3. 

2. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, staff recommends Approval of the porch changes for meeting all Guidelines and that this item be heard as a Consent Agenda item, with permit-ready construction drawings submitted to staff for final review. 

3. If requested by a Commission member, or if an interested party has signed up to speak in opposition, then the HDC shall open the application for a full hearing.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMA 2020-00311, 216 S. SUMMIT AVENUE – NEW CONSTRUCTION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The property is a vacant lot that measures approximately 54’ x 187.5’. A 10’ alley is located at the rear of the lot. Adjacent structures are 1, 1.5, and 2-story single-family structures There are three large canopy trees on the lot – a 36” evergreen located at the front corner, a 24” pecan mid-lot, and an 18” pecan in the rear. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is new construction of a single-family structure and detached accessory dwelling unit (ADU). 

Single-family structure: 

• Proposed height is 28’-0” as measured from grade to ridge. 

• Proposed width is 39’-4” 

• Front porch is 8’ deep, wood t & g flooring perpendicular to the front wall of the house. 

• Proposed materials are fiber cement siding (Hardie Artisan smooth or Nichiha Savannah smooth) and brick in a traditional color. Windows will be aluminum clad with Simulated True Divided Lights (STDL). 

ADU: 

• Proposed footprint: 25’-0” x 35’-4” 

• Proposed height: 23’-5” 

Trees: 

• Both the 36” evergreen and the 18” pecan are proposed for removal. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 6

1. Context References: 

a. 413 Grandin is not considered historic as it has had a major second story addition. 

b. Garages at 512 Grandin, 601 Walnut and 304 S. Summit were all approved under old guidelines. 

2. Height, Width, Scale References: 

a. Scale and height are much larger than other single family buildings on the block. 216 has much less roof and higher eave lines than even the multi-family buildings on the block. 

b. 220 and 208 S. Summit are multi-family buildings. 

c. 201 S. Summit is a single-family building. 

d. Both 515 and 517 Walnut Avenue are additions to existing structures; not new construction. 

e. Houses in Hermitage Court are much grander and at a larger scale and massing than the buildings that comprise the Wesley Heights neighborhood. 

f. The front porch appears to be more a ¾ width than a full width front porch, which is out of proportion for the style house proposed and affects the scale and massing. 

3. Fenestration and rhythm on right elevation first level. 

4. Tree removal of the 36” evergreen at the front of the lot. 

5. ADU. 

a. Setback may need to be adjusted by a 1’ or so because setbacks on accessory buildings are measured to the furthest projection, which is the eave line, not the foundation. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

Ms. Bergmann, adjacent property owner, spoke in opposition of this application due to the tree removal request. 

MOTION: CONTINUED 1 st : HENNINGSON 2 nd : HADEN 

Mr. Henningson moved to continue this application for the following: Height, per guideline 6.6, number 2, reduce the height to be no taller than the tallest historic single-family house within 360-degree view. Trees - provide accurate tree sizing and a planting plan that does not leverage the planting strip. Provide a tree protection plan for the front trees and evaluate other construction or foundation techniques to minimize the impact on the root structure. Fenestration - add a shared jamb for clustered windows. On the main level on the front elevation, the windows should be larger and align to a hierarchy in window size and dimension between first floor and the second floor, and the windows on the right and left elevation towards the front of the house should be larger, and the second-level windows need to be better aligned with the height. Foundation - Per guideline 6.9, number 1, relate the height of the foundation to the height of the foundations on the historic buildings within the context. Porch - Increase the width of the front porch. Overhang - Ensure that the eave overhangs on the porch match the main house. ADU - Ensure that you follow guideline 8.9 when revising the height of the main house. 

Ms. Hindman made a friendly amendment, the level two window height is relative to the context specific to the house and surrounding houses. The porch width is related to the tightness to the windows on the main level. Porch width is relative to the breathing room to the location of the main level windows. To protect the tree in the front is the coordination between the architect, engineer and the arborist. 7

• Guideline 6.6, number 2: The proposed height of the building should be no taller than the tallest historic building on the block with a 360-degree view, and 

• Guideline 6.1, the preamble: which speaks to context, as well as commercial on the fringe, whereby scale reducing techniques should be used to help minimize the impact on the neighborhood. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The proposed project site is currently a vacant lot being used for parking. It is located at the edge of the Plaza Midwood local historic district. Lot size is approximately 50’ x 150. 

PROPOSAL:

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Material clarification needed: is the Hardie siding going to be the Artisan line? Fiber cement shake siding has not been approved by the Commission due to dimensions, shadow-lines, and uniform appearance.

HDCCMI 2020-00324, 1513, 1515, 1521 S. MINT STREET – COMMERCIAL BUILDING REHABILITATION 12 

This application as continued from the September 9, 2020 meeting for the following items: 

• Provide accurate drawings and more detail on the clerestory addition, on any fenestration changes, 

on the awnings and murals. Dimensions and materials must be noted on all elements (windows, 

awnings, murals, etc.). 

• The presentation should show side-by-side, on the same page, elevations of the existing building, 

what was previously approved, and a new proposed elevation of what is being changed/asked for 

now. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing properties are connected brick Industrial/Commercial buildings. 1513 was constructed c. 1927 and 1515 was constructed c. 1946. 

1513 is a three-bay building. Material is brick running bond (painted) with a parapet roof with decorative solider course brick at the roofline and above the storefront openings. Most of the original storefront openings have been infilled over the years with a combination of glass block and wood paneling. The transom windows over the left and center bays appear to retain the original metal windows framed in wood trim. The three signage spaces appear to be later additions. The rear third of the building appears to be a later addition. The lot size is approximately 50’ x 150’. 

1515 is four-bay building with smaller storefront windows, recessed front entry, and a garage bay. Material is brick common bond, painted. A solider course of inset brick runs the length of the building above the windows and doors giving the storefront a modified tripartite design. The top third of the building has inset header bricks that form a rectangle across all four bays, likely originally intended as an area for signage. The lot size is approximately 50’ x 150’. 

1521 is a vacant gravel lot used for parking. Adjacent structures are commercial buildings, parking lots and single family residential to the rear along Westwood Avenue and Wickford Place. 

On September 11, 2019, the Commission approved fenestration changes, existing windows storefronts and doors, painted brick, restoration of historic transom windows, parking area improvements, and the demolition of a non-historic rear addition at 1513 S. Mint. The approval did not include signage, murals, awnings, or lighting. 

PROPOSAL: 

1513 S. Mint Street 

• Rear Addition. A clerestory addition of 3’-2” will be added to the rear portion of the building to allow 

for natural light and proper roof drainage at the addition. The height is no higher than the top of the 

adjacent building’s barrel roof. 

• Lighting. 

• No changes to front elevation. 

1515 S. Mint Street 

• East Elevation – storefront window and door changes. 

• No change to front elevation. 

• South Elevation – new door and canopy removed. 13 

Revised Proposal – October 14, 2020 

• Detailed drawing of clerestory 

• Fenestration changes, awnings, lighting changes shown side-by-side on same page with dimensions 

and materials noted. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 1. Minor changes may be approved by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: APPROVED 1st : HENNINGSON 2nd : HADEN 

Mr. Henningson moved to approve this application as written. We approve the painting of the brick on the clerestory and the rear elevation on 1513 because painting the brick will unify the CMU or non-historic additions with the historic building.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI 2020-00388, 405 HEATHCLIFF STREET – ADDITION/ACCESSORY BUILDING 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a one-story, American Small House constructed c. 1958. According to the Wesley Heights National Register Nomination, the house was moved to this lot in 1994. The house is wrapped in vinyl siding and had vinyl 1/1 replacement windows. It is unclear if the front stoop is original. Based on the design, size and scale of the porch supports, these appear to be later additions. There are very few original distinguishable architectural features on this house, which may or may not be present under the vinyl siding. Lot size is 63’ x 150’. Surrounding structures are 1 and 1.5 story single family buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project has multiple elements, including: 

1. Front portico design change. 

2. Rear addition of heated space that ties below the original ridge. 14 

3. Remove the vinyl siding and replace any original siding with new Hardie siding. Replacement window and door trim is also proposed. 

4. Construction of a new garage with living space above at the rear of the lot. Footprint is approximately 23’-0” x 32’-0’ and height is 22’-6” as measured from grade to ridge but sits below the house due to lot topography. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Front Elevation: 

a. Replacement front door – dentil molding is incongruous for the architecture of this house. 

b. Porch flooring is wood decking, not tongue and groove flooring. 

c. Design of porch columns are incongruous with the architecture of the house. Full length square wood columns would be more appropriate to the house. 

2. Left Elevation: 

a. Loss of roof return and rear corner board at transition between original house and addition. 

b. 8 x 8 column noted at rear corner of addition but not drawn. 

c. Eze-Breeze noted; however, plans show siding and double-hung wood windows. 

3. Rear Addition 

a. Clarification needed. Eze-Breeze noted; however, the plans show double-hung wood windows as drawn. Eze-Breeze has not been approved by the Commission. 

4. Accessory Building

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI 2020-00470, 2409 CHARLOTTE DRIVE – PORCH CHANGES 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing building was originally a one-story Picturesque Revival constructed in 1925 with a major two-story addition at the rear. Architectural features include an asymmetrical façade with a catslide roof over an engaged recessed entry. The existing front stoop is a small concrete area at the front door. The entire house is wrapped in vinyl siding. Lot size is approximately 50 x 155. Adjacent structures are one and two-story single-family buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is to expand an existing front stoop to the left edge of the house. Proposed materials are bluestone with a brick rowlock edge and brick steps. A small brick walk will connect the expanded patio to the existing driveway. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. With the exception of the bluestone flooring, the porch design is not incongruous with the District. If the porch floor material was changed to concrete, broken-terracotta tile, or brick, then the proposed project would meet the guidelines for Porches, 4.8 and Additions 7.2. 

2. Additional information about the addresses provided by the applicant that have bluestone on the front porch or front walk: 

a. The example image, labeled 1B, on the site plan is 2325 Charlotte Drive. In reviewing Google street view, the original patio at 2315 Charlotte Drive was broken terracotta with a brick rowlock. 

b. 1926 Ewing - Approved in March 2012 under old guidelines, HDC 2012-042. 

c. 2125 Dilworth East – According to Google street view, the front walkway was the original concrete in 2011. Sometime between 2011 and May 2014 the front walk was changed to 16 

brick. By March 2015, the walkway was widened and steps to the street both changed from brick to stone. 

d. 1215 E. Worthington – According to Google street view, the bluestone has been present since at least 2007. According to property tax records, the house was extensively remodeled in 2006. 

e. 2137 Dilworth East – Difficult to see but appears to have been stone since at least 2007 (as indicated by Google street view). 

f. 2111 Dilworth East – Approved in November 2010 under old guidelines, HDC 2010-118 

3. Minor changes may be approved by staff (such as floor material).
