Members of the public that are present to speak on the Consent Agenda items must use the WebEx “raise your hand” tool to be recognized by the Chair. If any member of the public requests to speak or if a Commissioner asks for the project to be placed on the Regular Agenda for a full hearing, then the case will be moved to the next available regular Historic District Commission meeting date. Any Commissioner wishing to request the floor on a meeting topic will use the WebEx “raise your hand” tool to be recognized by Staff or the Chair. Commissioners are asked to announce, for the record, if one leaves or arrives during the meeting. Chairman Haden will do a round robin and ask each Commissioner individually if they have questions for staff or wish for the project to undergo a full hearing. The Commission will make a MOTION to affirm the Consent Agenda item or to move 

APPROVED JUNE 10, 2020 the case to a future regular agenda for a full hearing. A majority vote of the Commission members present is required for a decision to be reached. Chairman Haden asked that everyone please mute your audio when not speaking, to use only one source of audio (computer OR phone), and do not place telephones on hold. Chairman Haden also instructed attendees to turn off or silent electronic devices and not to speak over the person talking.

N/A 

APPLICATION: HDCRMI 2020-00142, 1926 EWING AVENUE – FENESTRATION CHANGES 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a one-story side-gabled cottage built c. 1930. Architectural features include Colonial Revival elements as visible in the in the 6/6 window configuration and the arched entry porch and gable eave returns. The lot size is approximately 57’ x 178’. Adjacent structures are one- and two-story single-family houses. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project includes changing the fenestration on an existing bump-out on the left elevation. The four existing small windows (one on the front elevation, two on the side elevation, and one on the rear elevation) will be changed to larger casement windows measuring approximately 28 ¾ x 48 ¾. The proposed windows are Jeld-Wen Siteline wood casements with 5/8” putty glaze Simulated True Divided Lights (STDL) in a pattern to coordinate with the existing house. All trim will be wood with dimensions and details to match existing. 

But for the location of the proposed window changes (front elevation and visible side elevation), the project would otherwise be eligible for Administrative approval. The location of the window changes is what requires full Commission review. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 

1. The proposal is not incongruous with the District and meets the guidelines for Windows, 4.12-4.14. 

2. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, staff recommends Approval of the window changes for meeting all Guidelines and that this item be heard as a Consent Agenda item. 

3. If requested by a Commission member, or if an interested party has signed up to speak in opposition, then the HDC shall open the application for a full hearing. SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]:
