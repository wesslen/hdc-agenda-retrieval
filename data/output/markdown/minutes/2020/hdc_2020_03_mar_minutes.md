APPLICATION : HDCRMA 2019-00748, 201 GRANDIN ROAD – ADDITION/FENESTRATION CHANGES 

This application was continued from the January 15, 2020 meeting for the following items: 

Re-study the window changes preservation and retention of the windows in the position currently in now per the following Guidelines: 

 4.14, number 1. Retain and preserve windows 

 4.14, number 2. Repair existing, original windows 

 4.14, number 3. Replace window features only when beyond repair 

 4.14, number 5. Retain glass screen/shutter the backside of window 

 4.14, number 6. Avoid adding or changing window openings. 

 Secretary of the Interior’s Standards, page 2.5, number 1. “…or be placed in new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building.” 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :The existing structure is a Romanesque Revival church designed by renowned Charlotte architect Louis Asbury and constructed in 1928. The “T” shaped building contains both sanctuary and offices. The Church section has a gable facing Grandin Road. Notable architectural features include the triple entry with marbled windows, brick with crenellations, pilasters and corbelling details, cast stone trim, and arched, marbled windows. The property also includes a 1.5 story brick rectory constructed c. 1940. The rectory is an American Small House with Tudor and Colonial Revival details. Adjacent structures 1, 1.5 and 2-story single family residential buildings and 2-3-story multi-family townhomes. The lot size is approximately 108’ x 187.5’. The parcel is zoned MUDD(CD). 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is the conversion of a former church into condominiums. No changes are proposed to the front elevation. The only proposed change to the rear elevation is to add windows on the basement level in dimensions and configuration to match existing; proposed material is aluminum clad. On the right (courtyard) elevation the windows on the basement level will be changed to aluminum clad patio doors. A single-entry door will be removed and bricked in to match existing. The stained-glass windows will be removed, and the openings enlarged. The left (W. 4 th St) elevation also includes the removal of all stained-glass windows and enlarging the openings. Portions of the windows are proposed to be re-used in the entry doors. Brick steps and partition walls will provide access and separation between the units. An addition will be constructed on the courtyard side of the building behind the existing parsonage. Proposed materials are brick to match existing and aluminum clad Simulated True Divided Light (STDL) windows and doors. 

Revised Proposal – March 11, 2020 

• Window design changed on right elevation 

• Windows noted to be re-used and relocated on the left elevation 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following concerns with the proposal: 

1. Primary concern: loss of all original, character-defining stained-glass windows on both the left and right elevations. A design solution to keep at least one elevation largely intact would be more suitable. 

2. Left Elevation: 

a. The design does not match the notes. Notes state “existing stained-glass windows to remain but raised 36”; however, the drawing shows a different design. 

3. Right Elevation: 

a. Is the sill being moved and changed from cast stone to brick? 

b. Window design of the original building on both the left and right sanctuary elevations are symmetrical and have decorative arched headers. The window design change from an arched to square headers, is incongruous with the original symmetry of the building design. 

c. Single entry door is shown as removed in the elevations. If removed, will the cast concrete detail be replicated? 

d. Will there be knee-walls or some other type of partition between the patios? 

4. Addition: 

a. Label size (footprint and height dimensions) on plans. 

b. Dimensions of porch supports? 

c. Label tree species and size on the site plan for both trees proposed for removal and new trees to be planted. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST] :

MOTION : CONTINUE 1st : HENNINGSON 2nd : PARATI

The rear elevation of the addition is not incongruous with the neighborhood, with the exception of, the sidelights on the rear elevation. We request you revisit the fenestration per guideline 6.12. Add additional details, AC unit placement, trash, etc. to the site plan. 

Ms. Hindman made a friendly amendment, the rear elevation is only the sidelights of the doors, not all of the fenestration. 

Mr. Henningson accepted the friendly amendment.
