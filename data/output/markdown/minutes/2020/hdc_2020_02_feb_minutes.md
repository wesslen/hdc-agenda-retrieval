ABSENT: HENNINGSON, JORDAN, LINERGER, MURYN, HINDMAN 

APPLICATION: HDCRMI 2019-00819, 933 BERKELEY AVENUE – ACCESSORY BUILDING ADDITION, SCREEN PORCH 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a two-story brick Colonial Revival constructed in 1933. Architectural features include one-story side wings, 6/6 double-hung windows, and a classical cornice detail with dentil molding and pent eaves. The lot size is an irregular pie shape measuring 171 x 177 x 71 x 88. The Dilworth National Register Nomination specifically mentions a garage. However, the architecture of the existing carport indicates that it is not an original structure but built more recently to compliment the main house. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is in two parts: 

1. Main House: Addition of a wood frame screen system to the existing rear porch. All traditional materials proposed, and the screen system is completely reversible. The rear porch was a 2004 addition to the house. 3

2. Accessory Structure: Changes to the existing carport, including a one-story addition. The addition will be approximately the same size and location as an existing concrete pad located behind the carport structure. A carriage-style wood garage door and German lap wood siding will convert the open carport to an enclosed garage space. All traditional materials to match existing, including double-hung wood windows, wood doors, brick/mortar, etc. There are no impacts to mature canopy trees; ornamental trees may have to be removed to construct the carport addition. Post-construction, rear yard impermeable area will be approximately 40.5%. 

1. STAFF ANALYSIS: The proposal is not incongruous with the District and meets the guidelines for Additions, 7.2, and Accessory Buildings, 8.9. 

2. All landscaping and site features (walkways, fences, etc.), may be reviewed and approved at the Administrative level. 

3. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, staff recommends Approval of the screen porch and carport changes/addition for meeting all Guidelines and that this item be heard as a Consent Agenda item. 

4. If requested by a Commission member, or if an interested party has signed up to speak in opposition, then the HDC shall open the application for a full hearing. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak either for or against this application.

ABSENT: HENNINGSON, JORDAN, LINERGER, MURYN, HINDMAN 

APPLICATION: HDCCMI 2019-00816, 501 W PARK AVENUE - ADDITION [COMMERCIAL] 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The Greater Galilee Baptist Church was constructed in 1932, and the McKissick Building, was constructed in 2003. The campus is located in the heart of the Wilmore Local Historic District, with the sanctuary and fellowship hall located in a triangle of West Park Avenue, South Mint Street and Spruce Street. Wilmore Drive is on the back side of the campus. A long process was completed in 2010 to reconfigure the campus and relocate houses. The Commission approved the project on March 9, 2011 and the COA was issued August 22, 2011 (COA# 2010-080A). On November 13, 2019, the Commission approved plans for changes to existing door/window openings and the relocation of access stairs on the McKissick Building, COA# HDCCMI-2019-00695. 

PROPOSAL: 4

The proposed project is the construction of a one-story addition and elevator shaft to the main church building on the Greater Galilee Baptist Church campus. The addition is oriented to West Park Avenue. The only proposed alteration to the original building that is to a large second story window on the 1932 section of the church building, which will be altered to accommodate the new elevator shaft. It is unclear if any windows on the first level will be removed to accommodate the elevator shaft. Non-historic elements proposed for removal include the metal awning over the walkway and a monument sign. All materials and architectural details are inspired by the architecture of the church. There are no impacts to mature canopy trees; ornamental trees/bushes may have to be removed. 

1. STAFF ANALYSIS: Lot configuration results in all sides of the building being significantly visible. 

2. The location of the addition on West Park Avenue is the less intrusive than placement along Spruce Street, especially as viewed from South Mint Street, a main thoroughfare through the Wilmore neighborhood. 

3. The addition appears to be completely reversible with minimal changes being made to the church structure. 

4. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS 1 st : PHARES 2 nd : BONAPARTE 

Mr. Phares made a motion to approve this application with the condition the signage treatment and façade treatment come back for commission review.

MS. HINDMAN ARRIVED TO THE MEETING AT 1:34 PM 

APPLICATION: HDCRMI 2019-00746, 1911 S MINT STREET – ADDITION WINDOW REPLACEMENT 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a brick American Small House built c. 1940. The house has a few minimal Colonial Revival/Tudor elements as visible in the 6/6 window configuration and the front gable roof detailing. The metal awnings and metal porch rails/posts appear to be later 1960s additions. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project includes three main elements: 

1. Replacement of all existing double-hung wood windows with new double-hung wood windows. 

2. Fenestration changes to an infilled front porch. Changing the existing window size and configuration and installing new casement windows. 

3. A small addition at the right/rear corner of the house. 

There are no impacts to mature canopy trees. No change to the rear yard permeability. 5

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following concerns with the proposal: 

1. Additional documentation needed for the existing conditions of the wood windows proposed for replacement. 

2. Fenestration changes on the front elevation changing from symmetrical to asymmetrical, and the introduction of a new window style on a primary elevation. 

3. Removal of the vent detail on the right elevation. 

4. Clarification on the siding to be used throughout the project. On sheet A-4.0, the Existing Front Elevation drawing is noted that damaged lap siding will be replaced to match existing. Proposed Front Elevation drawing is noted that the damaged lap siding will be replaced with James Hardie lap siding. If Hardie is being proposed, then: 

a. Issue with existing German lap wood siding being proposed for removal and replacement with Hardie siding. 

b. Does the profile of the proposed James Hardie lap siding also match the existing German lap siding? 

5. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: APPROVED/CONTINUED 1 st : PARATI 2 nd : RUMSCH 

Ms. Parati moved to approve the addition because it meets guidelines 7.2. The siding will be German lap siding to match the existing siding on the house. The applicant showed evidence the double hung wood windows, according to guideline 4.14, were beyond repair and the replacement of the double-hung wood windows should match the existing windows. The fenestration on the front façade is continued for a restudy. The vent detail on the right elevation will remain. 

VOTE: 8/0 AYES: BARTH, BONAPARTE, HADEN, HINDMAN, PARATI, PHARES, RUMSCH, WALKER 

NAYS: NONE 

DECISION: 

APPLICATION FOR ADDITION AND REPLACEMENT WINDOWS APPROVED. THE WINDOWS ON THE FRONT FAÇADE ARE CONTINUED FOR A RESTUDY.

ABSENT: HENNINGSON, JORDAN, LINEBERGER, MURYN 

APPLICATION: HDCRMA 2019-00762, 1028 ISLEWORTH AVENUE – ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a two-story, Colonial Revival House constructed c. 1930. The house has a few minimal Colonial Revival elements visible in the side gable eave returns, gable end chimney, and the symmetrical façade. There is a one-story rear ell, and a one-bay, one-story side porch projection, which has been enclosed with windows to create a sunroom. Exterior material is unpainted brick. A two-car frame garage is located behind the house. Lot size is 55’ x 200’. Surrounding structures are one- and two-story single-family buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project has multiple elements, including: 

1. Front portico design change. 6

2. A second-level addition to the existing one-story side porch projection. 

3. Rear addition. Details and materials to match existing. 

4. Request to paint the entire exterior of the house. 

5. Demolition of the existing garage. 

6. Construction of a new two-bay brick garage – may be eligible for Administrative review due to location. 

7. Replacement shutters on the front elevation –eligible for Administrative review. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following concerns with the proposal: 

Rear Addition has details to work out including: 

1. Fenestration and rhythm on right elevations of the addition. 

2. Window trim detailing in the areas of siding– sill dimensions and crown molding. 

3. HVAC location/screening. 

4. Locations of mature canopy trees on the site plan. 

5. Rear yard permeability calculations. 

6. Material details: siding dimensions, window material/manufacturer, etc. 

Front Elevation Changes: 

7. Proposed shutter changes. Even though current shutters are not sized correctly for the windows, the proposed shutters appear to be more narrow than existing. 

Side Porch Projection Changes: 

8. Fenestration. Window design (transoms) and the lack of windows on the second level on both the left and rear elevations. 

9. Massing and Roof forms. 

a. Eave line is higher than the main house. Typically, when second levels are added to existing one-story wing projections, the eave line on the second story addition is lower than the main house. 

b. Decorative rail may be appropriate for a one-story side porch projection but is incongruous with a two-story projection on a Colonial Revival-style house. 

c. Flat roof on the second story is incongruous with the existing house. On Colonial Revival-style houses, flat roofs are typically found on one-story projections. Two-story projections usually have pitched rooflines that match the main roof and are also lower than the house’s main ridge. A gable roof with eave returns or a hip roof is more in-keeping with the design and massing of this particular house. 

i. High-style examples of one-story projections with a flat roof and railing in Dilworth include: 1316, 1318, 1326 Dilworth Road and 708, 734, and 827 Berkeley Avenue. 

ii. 1017 Isleworth is an example of a two-story side projection. 

Painted Brick: 

10. The Commission will determine if the brick may be painted based on the evidence provided. 

Garage – New Construction: 

11. Garage doors should either be two separate doors or detailed to appear as two-separate doors, per page 8.9, #6. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: DENIED/CONTINUED 1 st : PARATI 2 nd : RUMSCH 7

Ms. Parati moved to continue the side porch, for a restudy, according to guidelines 6.5, 6.10, 4.8# 5 and 6, and the federal guidelines. A restudy of the portico according to guideline 4.8, and a restudy of the right-side elevation historic windows according to guidelines 4.4, #6. 

To continue the addition for the stepping down of the ridge line, fenestration, rhythm, the massing, the materials, trim, and window head heights for compatibility. Included in the massing, the massing of the fireplace projection and vent shown on the elevation according to guidelines 7.2, #2, 3, 5, 6, 6.5, 6.10 numbers 3 and 4, and 4.7. 

Applicant to provide more information about the replacement windows and a restudy of the fenestration once the massing has been addressed. The existing elevations to be updated to show accurate fenestration. Applicant to provide a site plan including the trees, HVAC system and rear yard calculations. As well as, the footprint of the house, in relation to the surrounding structures and accurate calculations of the current square footage.
