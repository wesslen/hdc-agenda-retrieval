APPLICATION: HDCCMI 2020-00124, (PID 12105402) – 215 EAST WORTHINGTON AVENUE – COMMERCIAL SIGNAGE AND OUTDOOR SEATING 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure is a one-story brick commercial structure-built c. 1956. The building is a mix of concrete block with a brick façade, and all masonry is painted. The lot size is approximately 56’ x 115’. The building is at the edge of the Dilworth local historic district, located just off South Boulevard. An existing historic pole sign is to be re-used per an earlier decision by the Commission. Adjacent structures are one- and two-story commercial buildings and single-family houses. The parcel was formerly zoned B-1 and was rezoned to TOD-UC in September 2019. TOD is considered a Corridor Zoning District. The HDC Design Guidelines for Signage are the same for B-1 and Corridor Zoning districts. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is the installation of an outdoor seating area in front of the building to replace a front yard parking lot. The existing asphalt parking area will be changed to a stamped concrete patio. Large, moveable, fiberglass planter boxes measuring approximately 18’ x 48’ will be installed along the edges of the patio to define the space. The planters will feature a greenscreen trellis panel measuring 36” x 46”. The total height of the planters and greenscreens from grade is approximately 58”. There will be two (2) Painted steel 4” tube posts approximately 8’ in height installed at the front edge of the patio as anchors for strung café lights. Lighting on the building is not changing. 

New signage for the building is also proposed. An existing historic pole sign is required to be used per an earlier decision by the Commission, and the hanging sign measures approximately. 25” x 41 ½” (7.2 square feet). In addition to the pole sign the applicant is proposing the addition of two wall signs with each measuring approximately 93” x 56 ½” (36.5 square feet). One sign will be located on the front elevation over the entry doors and the second sign will be located on the left elevation over an entry door. Total wall proposed wall signage is 73 square feet. When combined with the required pole sign, total signage on the property measures approximately 80 square feet. STAFF RECOMMENDATION :

1. The proposal for outdoor seating is not incongruous with the District and meets the Secretary of the Interiors Standards, page 2.5. The project also removes a grandfathered, unscreened front parking lot. 

2. The Commission will determine if the proposed wall signage meets the Guidelines. 

3. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff.

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak either for or against this application.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMA 2020-00156, (PID 12302908) – 1424 EUCLID AVENUE – ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing building is a 1.5 story Colonial Revival house constructed c. 1936. Architectural features include front porch featuring a classical pedimented gable with eave returns, fanlight window, decorative molding, and square fluted columns. The front porch is screened. The house is painted brick. The lot size is approximately 70’ x 190’. Adjacent structures are one and two story single and multi-family structures. 

PROPOSED: 

The proposal is an addition of two small dormers on the front elevation and a rear addition. For the rear addition, the main ridge will not be raised, a new cross-gable will be added approximately 24’ behind the main ridge. The new cross-gable ridge will be approximately 3’ taller than the main ridge. Materials include Sierra Pacific aluminum clad windows and doors with ¾” Simulated True Divided Lights (STDL) and spacer bars in a 6/1 pattern to match the existing original windows. New dormers will have fiber cement lap siding and casing. Both the dormers and the rear addition will have a standing seam metal roof. The proposed project also includes the replacement of all original 6/1 double-hung wood windows. There are no impacts to mature canopy trees. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 

Staff has the following concerns about the proposal: 

1. Total replacement of all original 6/1 wood windows. 

2. Standing seam metal roofs on the front dormers. 

3. Apron trim under the window sills in the areas of siding, and the awning window shown in the field of brick on the right elevation. 

4. Thickness of the fiber cement siding. 

5. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: CONTINUED 1 ST : HENNINGSON 2 ND : BONAPARTE 

Mr. Henningson moved to continue this application for a restudy of the condition of the rear because on the second story, left and right elevations, the walls are coplanar. The additional massing on the left elevation is out too far. We want to see the following changes: Hardie Artisan specified on the plans. The windows will not be replaced, except for the two windows on the second story gable ends. Use casement windows that look like double-hung without increasing the window opening size, shingle roof on the front dormers and light pattern will mimic or complement the original windows. Do not add a new opening on the right elevation to add a window. 

FRIENDLY AMENDMENT :

Mr. Barth made a friendly amendment, remove the window on the right elevation where it is on the existing house. 

FRIENDLY AMENDMENT :

Ms. Hindman made a friendly amendment, do not add apron trim to the windows in the siding.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMA 2020-00157, (PID 11909529) – 1751 MERRIMAN AVENUE – ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The house is a one-story American Small House with Tudor Revival elements constructed in 1949. Exterior features include a prominent brick chimney, fixed diamond pane window, small engaged front porch, wood windows in a 1/1 pattern, and German-lap wood siding. 

PROPOSED :

The proposal is a rear addition. In April 2019, a rear addition was approved that extended the basement level and the main level. During excavation in preparation for construction a bed of graphite was discovered. The graphite abuts the original brick foundation of the house which makes extending the basement level to contain living space not feasible. Instead of fully excavating the rear yard, pilons will be drilled to support the main level addition. Due to this unique site topography, the applicant is requesting to increase the height of the main house. The existing ridge height is 17’-8” and the proposed ridge height is 21’-8”. All materials, trim, and details will match the existing house. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

Patricia Acosta spoke in favor of the project. 

MOTION: APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS 1 ST : HINDMAN 2 ND : HADEN 

Ms. Hindman moved to approve this application as drawn with a note, the window and door trim will match the existing as referenced in the photograph. If the upper gable on the left side steps back from the primary gable on the left that is great. We are fine with it either way, staff can work out the details.

HDCRMI 2020-00162, (PID 11909517) – 1701 MERRIMAN AVENUE – REAR ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure is a one-story side-gabled cottage-built c. 1930. Architectural features include a partial width front porch with a front gable roof supported by brick piers and wood columns, 6/6 double-hung wood windows, and German-lap siding with mitered corners. The lot size is approximately 68’ x 176’. Adjacent structures are one- and two-story single-family and multi-family buildings. 

PROPOSED :

The proposed project is a rear addition. All materials will match existing traditional features – siding, trim, vents. New windows proposed to be aluminum clad wood with Simulated True Divided Lights (STDL) in a 6/6 pattern to match existing. The fence is reviewable at the staff level. 

But for the corner lot location of 1701 Merriman Avenue, the project would be reviewable at the staff level, and due to the visibility of the project requires full Commission approval. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak either for or against this application.
