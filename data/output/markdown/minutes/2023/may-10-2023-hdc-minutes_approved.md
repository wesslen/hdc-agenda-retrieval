MOTION : CONTINUED 1st : GOODWIN 2nd : WOJICK 

Mr. Goodwin moved to continue this application to further study the roof forms to simplify the roof forms , specifically 

the number of pitches. The form is good, and these adjustments would be a minor detail. On the turret , eliminate any 

interference issues with the windows and the roof line. Regarding the materials , the applicant needs to provide window 

and door material specifications. The proposed tinted windows are not allowed per Standard 6.18 , number 3. The 

Commission asked the applicant to p rovide stained glass details for all the doors and s pecify the roof materials, per 

Standard 6.13 number 7 . They added that solar panels are not to be placed in highly visible area s. The applicant should 

provide the thickness of the siding materials , details and materials for the window and door trim, and details of the 

material for the columns , beams , and railings. The applicant should m ake the rear elevatio n garage door appear as two 

separate doors. They should p rovide details and material specifications for the exterior drapes that are shown in the 

elevations and the porch flooring . For proposed site features, the applicants will provide dimensions and details for all 

hardscape features , material specifications for the walkways, and fencing details and materials. Mr. Goodwin cited 

Standard 6.13 number 1 through 5 for roof forms , all of the Standards in Chapter 6, Standard 6.18 , num ber 3 for the 

tinted windows, Standard 6.13 , number 7, for the solar panels under the section on roof forms. Overall, the applicant 

should reference Chapter 6. For guidance on site features, the applicant should consult Chapter 8 and Standard 8.7, 

number 11. 

Ms. Lineberger made a friendly amendment citing Standard 4.14, number 20 on windows and the use of translucent 

glass. 

Commissioner Barth made a friendly amendment per Staff notes which pointed out that on the rear elevation there are 

two windows on the upper story that are smaller in scale, double -hung windows. The proportions are not in keeping 

with the architectural style . Mr. Barth suggested the applicant look at a transom window , sash, or some other style of 

windows to keep with the ve rtical orien tation. On the right elevation there are three upper windows that he would like 14 

to make same comment about . He also pointed out there was a note in the Staff Analysis regarding the stone path .

Those are not typically seen the Fourth Ward neighb orhood, so the applicant should revise it to be brick or find 

examples in the neighborhood that provide context . For his comments on windows, Mr. Barth cited Standard 6.15 ,

number 1 .

Ms. Bell made a friendly amendment that Standard 8.2 , number 2 offers guidance for sidewalk material s.
