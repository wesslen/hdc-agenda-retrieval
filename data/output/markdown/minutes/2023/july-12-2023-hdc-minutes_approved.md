approximately 6’ x 13’ and will be stepped in 58” from the left rear corner of the original house. Proposed materials 

include unpainted brick foundation to match existing and fiber cement lap siding. The new transom window is proposed

the Secretary of the Interiors Standards. 

2. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, Staff recommends Approval of the project for meeting the Standards

provided by the applicant. 

Mr. Barth made a friendly amendmen t requesting the applicant work with Staff to match the brick to the existing, noting 

that no brick should be painted. He added that the siding material should conform the Standards and that it should be 

chosen in consultation with Staff but be either a Ge rman lap siding or Hardie Artisan, or a comparable lap siding with 

mitered corners or wood cornerboards sitting proud of the siding by a quarter inch. Mr. Barth continued his friendly 

amendment stating that skylights should not be used and that the windows could be aluminum clad but that the 

applicant should work with Staff on the window proportions, sizing, and light pattern. The eaves, trim, and cornic e detail 

on the addition should all match the existing house, and the applicant needs to provide rear yard calculations to Staff 

prior to the commencement of the project. For this comment, Mr. Barth cited Standard 6.12 for foundations, 6.13 for 

roof form a nd materials, 6.14 for windows and doors , as well as Standards 6.15 -6.16 for rhythm and 6.18 for materials.

to deal with the grade change, whether that be via a retaining wall or ivy, but something other than boulders that would 

be in keeping with the context of the neighborhood. She also asked that the tree protection plan already submi tted be 

expanded to include the location of all trees, and to mark those that are being protected. Ms. Wojick seconded the 

motion.

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST] :

Several members of the public signed up to speak in opposition to the proposed application. The speakers included Ellen 

Citarella, Denise Walsh, Russell Ruckerstuhl, Kay Chel en a, and Tiffany George -Kete. 

MOTION : CONTINUE D 1st : WHITLOCK 2nd : PARATI 

Mr. Whitlock made a motion to continue the application for several reasons including context, spacing per Standard 7.5, 

scale per Standards 7.9, massing per Standards 7.8, Chapter 8 broadly, the impact on the larger trees per Standard 8.5, 

lighting per Standards 8.12, and to relook at permeability. 

Ms. Parati added a friendly amendment that the Commission now review a number of the details until larger questions 

are answered. Ms. Walker also asked for a precedent for two buildings on one site existing in a historic di strict. The 

Commissioners and Ms. Harpst discussed issues related to the site’s zoning and use. Ms. Parati asked for someone to 

supply the Standard for permeability, but Ms. Harpst reminded the Commissioners that the typical regulations about 

permeability they consider are not applicable to commercial properties. Ms. Bell suggested they consider the historical 

context of the neighborhood and how an addition like the proposed would fit into that. Ms. Hawkins offered Standard 

7.17 for additions and how they should remain secondary and attached to the rear. Mr. Barth added an amendment to 

request the applicant reference Staff notes for any other items the Commissioners did not cover in the initial motion. 

Mr. Whitlock accepted all the suggestions and amendments. Ms. Parati seconded the motion.
