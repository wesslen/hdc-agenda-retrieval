APPLICATION :

HDCRMI -2022 -00774 , 227 W PARK AV (PID: 11908918 ) – WINDOW REPLACEMENT – AFTER -THE -FACT 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure at 227 W Park Ave was built c. 1931. The primary structure is a 1 and 1/2 -story wood lap -sided 

house bungalow with a side gabled roof. The front porch is a brick foundation and has wood tapered columns on brick 

bases. The lot size is approximately 50’x 190’. Adjacent structures are mainly a mixture of 1- and 2 -story residential 

buildings .

PROPOSAL :

The proposal is the removal of the original wood 3 /1 double -hung windows and the installation of Jeld -Wen Siteline 

wood 3 /1 double -hung windows. The size and location of the original openings will not change. The applicant states that 

the original trim is rotted and will be replaced with wood trim to match the existing .

An addition to the primary structure was approved by th e Historic District Commission at the May 9, 2018 (COA# 

HDCRMA -2018 -00071). This approval stipulated that the original windows in the primary structure were to remain. HDC 

Staff approved the driveway and accessory building in December of 2018 (COA# HDCADMR M-2018 -00682). 

When Staff discovered the original windows were removed from the house, Staff reached out to the property owner 

(see attached correspondence). Staff and the property owner came to the agreement that the new Jeld -Wen windows 

installed on the main house would be removed and installed in the new accessory structure, which would allow the 

original wood windows to be reinstalled on the main house. This has not occurred. Staff can not approve the removal of 

original windows. 

The project is c onsidered an After -The -Fact review, with the Commission reviewing the project on its merits according to 

the Design Standards as if work has not yet occurred. 11 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Removing original windows is incongruous with the Standard for Windows (pages 4. 12 – 4.14 numbers 1, 

10, 11, and 12). 

2. Documentation of the window and trim conditions prior to removal has not been provided. 

3. The Commission has previously approved Jeld -We n Siteline wood windows, with a traditional width sash on 

new construction and when existing windows were demonstrated to be beyond repair. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST] :

No one accepted Chair Hawkins’ invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: DENIED 1st : PARATI 2nd : WOJICK
