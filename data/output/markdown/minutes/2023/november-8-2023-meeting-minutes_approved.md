With a quorum present, Chair Hawkins called the November meeting of the Historic District Commission (Commission) meeting to order at 1:03 pm. Chair Hawkins began the meeting by introducing the Staff and Commissioners and explaining the meeting procedure. All interested parties planning to give testimony – FOR or AGAINST – must submit a form to speak and must be sworn in. Staff will present a description of each proposed project to the Commission. The Commissioners and the Applicants will then discuss the project. Audience members signed up to speak either FOR or AGAINST will be called to the podium for each agenda item. Presentations by the Applicants and audience members must be concise and focused on the Charlotte Historic District Design Standards. The Commission and Staff may question the Applicant. The Applicant may present sworn witnesses who will be subject to questioning by the Commission and Staff. The Applicant will be given an opportunity to respond to comments by interested parties. After hearing each application, the Commission will review, discuss, and consider the information that has been gathered and presented. During discussion and deliberation, only the Commission and Staff may speak. The Commission may vote to reopen this part of the meeting for questions, comments, or clarification. Once the review is completed, a MOTION will be made to Approve, Deny, or Continue the review of the application at a future meeting. A majority vote of the 2

Commission members present is required for a decision to be reached. All exhibits remain with the Commission. If an Applicant feels there is a conflict of interest of any Commissioner, or there is an association that would be prejudicial, that should be revealed at the beginning of the hearing of a particular case. The Commission is quasi-judicial body and can accept only sworn testimony. Staff will report any additional comments received and while the Commission will not specifically exclude hearsay evidence, it is only given limited weight. Chair Hawkins asked that everyone please silence any electronic devices. Commissioners are asked to announce, for the record, if one leaves or arrives during the meeting. Chair Hawkins requested that those in the audience remain quiet during the hearings. An audience member will be asked once to be quiet and the need for a second request will require removal from the room. Chair Hawkins swore in all Applicants and Staff and continued to swear in people as they arrived for the duration of the meeting. Appeals from the Historic District Commission are to the Zoning Board of Adjustment within thirty (30) days from the date of the decision to appeal. This is in accordance with Section 10.213 of the City Zoning Ordinance. 

Before the meeting began, Ms. Harpst provided a few announcements including news about two staff hirings, a reminder about the upcoming fall HDC retreat, and a preview of Mr. Goodwin’s presentation on windows and energy efficiency. 

Then, Ms. Wojick moved to approve the July minutes. Vice Chair Parati seconded the motion, and it was approved by a vote of 10/0. 

Chair Hawkins then offered one minor change to the October minutes. Ms. Walker made a motion to approve the October minutes, with the adjustment. Mr. Whitlock seconded the motion, and it was approved by a vote of 10/0.

306 N. Graham Street (PID# 07806401): Constructed c. 1928, the two-story structure is a classic historic commercial building with a storefront on the first level, windows on the upper façade, and decorative cornice. The storefront windows are replacements but the highly decorative brick and cast stone detailing remain intact. 

A one-story brick building with a decorative stepped parapet connects the two-story commercial building with the one-story building located at 420 W. 6 th Street. 

420 W 6 th Street (PID# 07806402): One structure, constructed c. 1950. The building is a one-story, brick building with an American bond brick pattern in the front section, the middle section of the building has a running bond brick pattern, and the rear section of the building is concrete block.

The Commission approved Demolition of the structures with a 365-day stay on March 9, 2022 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is changes to a previously approved project. The Commission approved the new construction of a mixed-used multi-family and commercial building on March 8, 2023. The Approval with Conditions letter is attached. 

The proposed changes are detailed in side-by-side images in the attached presentation, see Sheets A8, A23, A25, A26, A36, A37, A38, A39, A40, A41, A42, A43, A44, and A45. The provided color renderings also show side-by-side-comparisons of the proposed changes. Some of the proposed adjustments include: 

• Building step-backs have changed. 

• Setbacks have increased along N. Graham Street. 

• An access stair was added between the historic building and new townhomes on N. Graham Street. 

• A rooftop use has been added to the historic building on N. Graham Street. The building design along 7 th street has also changed slightly. 

• Along N. Graham the building design changes are mostly to levels 1 and 2 to further given the impression of individual buildings using façade breaks. Some minor alterations have been made to levels 3-7 as well. The grading has also been adjusted. Stoops have been removed from some of the townhome units on N. Graham Street. 

• Minor changes made to the design of the 7 th Street elevation. 

• Rear elevation design has been changed to comply with Duke Energy requirements. The green wall has been eliminated as well due to concerns around lack of light and material breakdown. 

• Roof changes include the expansion of the parapet size. 

• The most significant change relates to the existing historic structure at 306 N. Graham St. Additional structural evaluation has determined the building is not salvageable and requires demolition. The applicants propose to reconstruct the front portion of the historic building and incorporate it into the project as originally planned. The restoration details are shown on A46. The only proposed change is to the second level above the windows, where a roof deck will be created. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS: 

1. The project is not incongruous with the district and meets the Standards for New Construction of Residential Buildings, Chapter 6 and New Construction of Non-Residential Buildings, Chapter 7. 8

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Chair Hawkins’ invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: CONTINUE 1 st : PARATI 2 nd : BARTH 

Vice Chair Parati moved to continue the application to provide the applicants time to restudy the rear elevation and come back with something closer to what the Commission previously approved. She asked the applicants to restudy the Juliet balconies as the full inset balconies had helped break up the massing and to restudy the step-backs as the levels increase to show some sort of delineation or separation between residential and commercial spaces. Vice Chair Parati cited Standard 7.7 for massing and 7.9 for scale to support her motion. Second Vice Chair Barth seconded the motion.

MOTION: CONTINUE 1 st : WOJICK 2 nd : BELL 

Ms. Wojick moved to continue the application to provide more time for the applicants to meet Standard 8.10, numbers 3 and 4. She added that the style of the architecture is inconsistent with the existing architecture on the primary structure and that the applicants should provide additional information on the measurements for the structure, the accuracy of the details, sections, information about the grade, the relationship of the foundation to the grade, and how all that will impact retaining walls and driveway access. She cited Standard 8.2 for massing, noting that the accessory structure should be clearly secondary and that the overall scale, height, and width of the structure should be more contextual with the neighborhood per Chapter 6 for new construction. 

Ms. Bell offered a friendly amendment to cite Standard 8.10, number 7, then seconded the motion. 

Second Vice Chair Barth offered a few additional friendly amendments requesting that the applicant provide details on the window trim, door and window material and specifications, a floor plan, and an accurate site plan. He also asked that the applicant restudy the windows and dormers to consider more vertical-oriented panes and different types of windows, that rear yard calculations taken from the historic rear thermal wall be provided, and that more detail about any grading or retainage that would need to occur with respect to the accessory structure’s foundation be provided. Ms. Wojick and Ms. Bell accepted the amendments.

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The Wilmore Elementary School was designed by Louis H. Asbury, Sr. and originally constructed in 1925. Two additions were made to the school. In 1948, the building was expanded to the east to house a cafeteria, auditorium, one classroom, and nurses’ room. The last addition was in 1970s when the rectangular wing was added to the front of the building and an addition at the rear of the building was constructed to contain a new library, workroom, lounge, classroom, administrative spaces, and two conference rooms. The 1948 addition was designed by architect Martin E. Boyer, Jr., and the 1970s addition by Tebee P. Hakwins & Associates. 

The original building and 1948 classroom addition is two stories in height (34.4’ including parapet), six bays long and one bay in depth. The building forms an L-shape with a one-bay by one-bay second on the northwest portion of the building. The building is clad in unpainted brick with a metal-capped parapet wall and what appears to be a flat gravel roof. The original building has stone water tables on all elevations with additional stone details on the south elevation. Wood double-hung windows comprise the majority of the fenestration and are presented either singular or in groups of three. Above the windows are brick soldier course lintels and at their base, brick sills. The lot size is approximately 400’ x 400’. Adjacent structures are 1.5 and 2-story residential buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is in two parts. 

1. Rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of the 1925 and 1948 portions of the historic Wilmore School building. The 1970s addition on the front will be removed and the original front façade restored. The 1970s rear addition will also be removed. The proposed project includes replacement of all windows. 

2. New construction of mixed-use building on the vacant land (currently an asphalt parking lot) surrounding the school building. The proposed new buildings are proposed to range in height from 37’ to 65’. Proposed exterior 13 

materials include red brick to coordinate with the school building and fiber cement lap siding on the uppermost level. Cast stone accents will be used at the foundation, roof/setback parapets, and entries. Proposed windows are vinyl single-hung with divided lights in a dark bronze or black color. 

Revised Proposal – November 8, 2023 

• Project is in three parts: 

1. Wilmore school building rehabilitation and adaptive reuse. 

2. New construction of a mixed-use building along S. Mint Street and a portion of West Boulevard.

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The site includes the former Dilworth Methodist Church South (1829 Cleveland Av) and vacant lot currently used for parking. The former church building was constructed c. 1915. Architectural features include a hip roof and domed belvedere, round arched bays with fanlights, and rectangular transoms over the front bays. The front elevation has a classical portico with a pedimented fanlight gable on massive Doric columns. The exterior is unpainted brick with cast stone accents. The existing building measures approximately 34.4’ in height from grade to ridge, and 50.4’ in height to the highest point. The lot size is approximately 150’ x 150’. Adjacent structures are a mix of 1 and 2 story residential and commercial structures. 

PROPOSAL: 15 

The proposed project in multiple parts: 1.) the relocation of the c. 1903 Leeper-Wyatt store building from South Boulevard to the project site with the setback to match 1829 Cleveland, 2.) rear addition, 3.) rooftop addition, and 4.) installation of new lighting. 

The only changes proposed to the historic building is the addition of lighting on all elevations. Lighting details are shown on Sheet HDC-4. 

The Leeper-Wyatt store building is proposed to be demolished under approved “1923 South Blvd Mixed Use” project 

(LDUTOD-2022-00010). It is a locally designated Historic Landmark and the relocation and proposed additions to the building will also require review by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmark Commission. 

Rear addition for egress stairs: 

• Measures approximately 39’-5” in height. 

• The footprint measures approximately 23’-6” x 11’-2”. 

• Windows will match existing on the original building. 

• A new service entry door will be installed on the left elevation. 

• Proposed materials are brick and mortar to match existing. 

Rooftop addition: 

• The central portion of the rooftop addition begins approximately 7’-8” from the rear of the parapet with the main portion of the addition beginning at 22’-6” from the rear of the parapet. 

• The addition will bring the total building height to approximately 42’-5 ½”. 

• Proposed materials are a metal and glass structure with standing seam metal roof. 

• A metal handrail will be installed behind the parapet. 

Note: This project is specifically being considered due to the relocation of the Leeper-Wyatt store building to preserve a designated Historic Landmark. The moving of the building, the construction of a rear addition and rooftop addition are all being considered together to support the relocation of the Leeper-Wyatt Store building. If the project is approved and the Leeper-Wyatt Store is not moved to this site, then no portion of the project may proceed and a new application for new construction will be required. 

Revised Proposal – November 8, 2023 

• Rear addition stepped in from left corner, see HDC-4, HDC-5, and HDC-7. 

• Rear addition roof changed. 

• Perspective Streetview renderings provided. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The proposed building with the rooftop addition will bring the total building height to approximately 42’-7 ½”. This is shorter than the new construction recently approved at 1913 Cleveland Avenue, which measures approximately 45’-4” in height at the front elevation on Cleveland Avenue. 

2. Rear addition 

a. New brick and mortar should be of a color and dimension similar to the existing and remain unpainted according to the Design Standards, Masonry 5.5 – 5.6 and Paint 5.8. 

3. Site work: 

a. Add note to site plan to note that the rolled curb, concrete steps and sidewalls will be reconstructed to match existing. 

b. Add a note to the site plan to indicate a minimum 18” planting strip will be left between the building foundation and any new paving. 

4. Minor changes may be approved by Staff, including property equipment enclosure details. 16
