EXISTING CON DITIONS :

with central entry flanked by large 12/12 windows, a hip roof, an exterior chimney on the left side. The front portico 

with metal roof supported by square col umns appears to be a later addition. The exterior is unpainted brick. The lot size 

is approximately 75’ x 174’. Adjacent structures are 1, 1.5 , and 2 -story residential buildings. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposal is for the addition of a window opening on the left elevation, second level, located in front of the brick 

chimney. The new window will be wood, double hung, 6/6, with wood trim and a brick sill to match existing. The unique 

stack bond brick pattern on either side of the window will also be matched. The dim ensions and pattern of the proposed 

new window opening matches existing windows on the right elevation of the house. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION S:

1. The project is not incongruous with the district and meets the Standards for New Construction of Residential 

Buil dings, Doors and Windows, 6.15 -6.16; Materials, 6.18; and the Secretary of the Interiors Standards. 

2. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, Staff recommends Approval of the project for meeting the Standards for 

New Construction, Chapter 6, for Doors and Win dows and Materials, and the Secretary of the Interior Standards, 

and that this item be heard as a Consent Agenda item, with the following Conditions: 

a. Provide cut sheets and specifications for proposed new windows that meet HDC Standards. 

3. If requested by a Commission member, or if an interested party has signed up to speak in opposition, then the

the Secretary of the Interior Standards.

APPLICATION :

HDC CMIA -2023 -0032 9, 715 EAST BV (PID: 12311814 ) – SIGNAGE – AFTER THE FACT 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :4

The existing structure is a multi -tenant commercial office building constructed c. 197 2, located on the in the center block 

between Lennox Ave and Springdale Ave with approximately 120’ of street frontage . The front elevation facing East 

Boulevard is 1 -story. Exterior material is stucco over brick . Roof form is flat with a parapet around the edge and a faux 

gable facing East Boulevard . Lot size is 193 ’ x 12 0’. Adjacent structures are 1, 1.5, and 2-story office and single -family 

structures .

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is the replacement of panels on the existing monument sign located on the left side of the front 

yard (Sign 1) and the removal of the second monument sign located on the right side of the front yard (Sign 2). 

Sign 1 was originally approved by the HDC in Sept ember 1996 ( COA # 96.153.D.97) as a 54” x 66” unlit monument sign, 

which is approximately 25.2 square feet in area. The replacement of the panels will allow for the names of both tenants 

to be on one sign instead of currently on two separate signs. There wi ll be no structural changes to this sign and the 

location will remain the same. As an existing non -conforming sign, the project requires full Commission approval. 

Sign 2 was installed without HDC approval between March 2020 and September 2022. This sign will be removed. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATIO NS:

1. Staff is recommending approval due to the special circumstances of the project in that the Commission originally 

approved the sign and because the base of the sign is not changing, only the panels are being updated to reflect 

new tenant information. 

2. The project is not incongruous with the Standards in that it meets the requirement for only one sign per street 

frontage for multi -tenant business properties thereby consolidating signage for multiple tenants, Appendix A 

number13; Urban Districts, General Commercial, and Research/Office Zoning Districts number 5; and Multi -

Tenant Business Properties withing All Zoning Districts number 2. 

3. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, Staff recommends Approval of the project for meeting the Standards for 

Signage, Appendix A, and the Secretary of the Interior Standards, and that this item be heard as a Consent 

Agenda item. 

4. If requested by a Commission member, or if an interested party ha s signed up to speak in opposition, then the 

HDC shall open the application for a full hearing. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST] :

No one accepted Chair Parati’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION : APPROVED 1st : WALKER 2nd : WOJICK 

Ms. Walker moved to approve the application as it is not incongruous with the Standards and the context of the 

neighborhood . She added that it was a repeat of an existing non -conformity approved in 1996. She approved it based on 

Standards Appendix A, number 13 referencing sign consolidation and size. Ms. Parati reiterated that this type of project, 

while currently not approvable per the m ost up to date Standards, is being grandfathered in and should not be used as a 

precedent in future cases.
