sills to pair windows; paint to match color of windows. 

f. Rear elevation, 2 nd story windows lower than in approved drawings . Proposed solution by applic ant 

is to maintain windows as built, except where noted at item #5.e

g. Door on right side rear wall – not built 

h. French doors – sidelights eliminated 

i. Rear patio – sunken c ourtyard and retaining wall – not built

c. The projecting sign (Horseshoe) on the right elevation will project more than six inches but is no more 

than six square feet in area (Page A.2 Within Urban Districts, General Commercial, and Research/Office 

Zoning Districts, #2); 14 

d. The two signs on the front elevation will each project less than 6” from the wall and each sign will be 

less than eight square feet in area (Page A.2 Within Urban Districts, General Commercial, and

with a side gable main roof with two unpainted, internal brick chimneys. The six -panel Colonial Revival front door

the foundation. Ms. Bell conditioned that the applicant work with Staff to apply the stucco and make sure it is not flush 

with the outside of the house, but instead applied in such a way that the siding is clearly proud of the foundation and 

that it should have a smooth finish, be a traditio nal material, and remain unpainted. Ms. Wojick seconded the motion.

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a 1.5 -story Craftsman house built c. 1 91 5. Architectural features include a front -gable roof, a 

bay window, exposed rafters, and 12/1 double -hung windows. The partial width engaged front porch features square 

columns with shake siding ; the right bay of the front porch was formerly infilled. T he lot size is approximately 50’ x 190’. 

Adjacent structures are a mixture of 1.5, 2 , and 2.5 -story residential and commercial buildings. A rear addition was 

approved under application HDCRMI -2021 -00918 on January 12, 2022. 

PROPOSAL: 

The project is the const ruction of a replacement fence in the rear yard. With the exception of a small adjustment to 

bring the fence onto the property at the left rear corner, the location of the fence is not changing. The new fence is 

proposed to be seven (7) feet in height. The fence design is shadowbox -style with horizontal trim across the top with the 

panels butt -joined to 6x6 uprights. The uprights will have decorative caps. There will be two, 4’ wide gates matching the 

style of the fence. The applicant is requesting an excep tion to the six -foot fence height maximum due to the adjacent 

commercial uses along the rear and right property lines. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Consider installing a 6’ tall fence along the left property line, which is adjacent to residential structures. 

2. Fencing should tie in at the rear corners of the house. If the fencing comes along the side yard, it should step 

down to 5’ and then 4’. 

3. Confirm that the finished fence will be painted or stained after an appr opriate curing time. 

4. The Commission shall determine if an exception should be granted for an 7’ fence.

Ms. Bell moved to approve the application per the Secretary of Interior’s Standards 2.5 and the Design Standards for 

fences and walls in Standards 8.6 through 8.7. She asked the applicant to work with Staff on where the fence height 

should drop from 7 ’ to 6 ’. Ms. Bell explained that the Commission was making an exception to the Standards that 

normally limit rear yard fences to 6 ’ because the applicant’s property faces commercial p roperties on the right and rear 

sides, and the Commission has made this exception in the past for properties in similar situations. 

Mr. Barth made a friendly amendment that the drop down in fence height should occur between a quarter and half of 

the run o n the left side. 

Ms. Wojick seconded the motion.
