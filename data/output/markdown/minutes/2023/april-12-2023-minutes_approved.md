The front porch will be approximately 2’ in height with a brick foundation and a floor of broken pieces of quarry tiles. The trellis will be 8’x8’ wood posts and steel beams faced with a wood beam. The side porch infill will be removed and replaced with metal clad single light doors and fixed door panels. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Front Porch: 

a. What are the footprint dimensions of the front porch? 

b. How will the new front porch impact the front chimney? 

c. Trellis columns need additional cap and base details. 

d. Provide a photo of the proposed quarry tile floor. 

e. Will the trellis attach to the building or just the new front porch? 

2. Side Porch Changes: 

a. Front elevation, door design appears incongruous with the 6/6 design of the original fenestration. 

b. Right elevation fenestration and trim design. 

c. On the rear elevation, will the steps be enlarged? Is a handrail needed? 

d. Proposed fenestration is metal clad. 

e. Trim details needed.

MOTION: CONTINUED 1 st : WOJICK 2 nd : BARTH 

Ms. Wojick moved to continue this project because the design elements are incongruous. She added that she liked the idea of the space being more of a porch again, but this proposed plan was not congruous. The Commission would like a restudy of the porch conversion and the new porch pergola design based on Standard 4.8, numbers 3 and 5 for porches noting the reference images on 4.9 images. They also referenced Standard 4.14, number 14 and 18, and The Secretary of Interior Standards Section 2.5. Ms. Wojick added that the applicant should review Standard 4.10, number 2 and Standard 4.10 number 4 directing property owners to not reduce or enlarge entrances or door openings 

Mr. Barth made a friendly amendment, stating that the windows need to complement the structure with regard to style and proportion per Standard 6.15, number 1 (a) through (d). 

Ms. Parati made a friendly amendment about Standard 6.15, number 2 which states: “Respect the traditional design of the openings...openings are generally recessed on a masonry building, while the element is surrounded by raised trim on a frame building. New openings that are flush with the rest of the wall are not allowed.” 13 

Ms. Walker made a friendly amendment referencing Standard 4.10, number 2, which prohibits the use of stock doors with details that provide a false sense of historical accuracy.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMIA-2022-01148, 1921 RUSSELL AV (PID: 07507919) – REPLACEMENT OF FRONT DOOR & WINDOW AND REMOVAL OF WINDOWS - AFTER THE FACT 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a Mid-Century Modern 1-story ranch with wood lap siding c. 1953. Architectural features include a gable roof at the right end of the house with front and truncated rear gable bump-outs at the left end of the house. It has a front and a rear stoop. The lot size is approximately 51’ x 160’ x 52’ x 161’. Adjacent structures are 1-story residential buildings. Staff approved the removal of vinyl siding (after-the-fact), window restoration (after-the-fact) and site work under COA # HDCADMRM-2022-00569; the front door and window changes were excluded in this COA. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is the replacement of the original front door and changes to the original triple window located to the right of the front door. The replacement front door will be a new wood door with a 3-over-3 window. The two original fixed windows on either side of the double hung window have been removed and the openings framed in and covered with wood lap siding. The project is considered an After-the-Fact review, with the Commission reviewing the project on its merits according to the Design Standards as if work has not yet occurred. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The removal of the original front door and the stock replacement door is incongruous with Design Standards 1 and 2 for Front Doors and Entrances (page 4.10). 

2. The removal of original windows is incongruous with Design Standards 1, 2 and 3 for Windows (pages 4.12-4.14). 

3. The change in configuration of the original front window and openings is incongruous with Design Standards 6 and 13 for Windows, (page 4.12-4.14) call for avoiding changes to the existing openings on primary elevations. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Chair Parati’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: DENIED 1 st : BELL 2 nd : BARTH 

Ms. Bell moved to deny this application based on Standards of Interior’s Standards listed in Section 2.5 as well as Sections 4.12, 4.13, and 4.14 for windows. The applicant is asked to work with Staff on selecting and approving the final materials. The original window size and framing needs to be reestablished to change from what is currently a single 14 

window back to a six-panel window. The door should be the same as the original materials. The door should return to the original construction. The applicant can work with Staff on all material and finalization selections.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMAA-2023-00061, 700 TEMPLETON AV (PID: 12305619) – BRICK STAINING – AFTER THE FACT 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The original structure was a one-story brick house constructed in 1936. A 365-day stay of demolition was placed on the property on July 13, 2016 (Case# HDC 2016-123). At the October 12, 2016, meeting a proposal for a new single-family house and detached garage was heard by the HDC and denied (Case# HDC 2016-254). The HDC approved Case# HDC 2016-274 at the March 8, 2017, meeting for a new single-family house. The lot size is approximately 50’x148’. Adjacent residential structures are a mix of 1 ½ and 2 story structures. A multi-family development is located behind the house. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is the staining of the brick on the new construction of the primary structure. Under the approval of case# HDC 2016-274 the original brick exterior was to remain, and new brick added to match existing. The original brick was completely removed and new brick/mortar that does not match the original historic brick was installed. Neither the removal of the brick nor the new brick was approved by either the Commission or Staff. The proposed solution for bringing the color of the new brick into compliance is staining the brick for a more traditional brick color. The project is considered an After-the-Fact review, with the Commission reviewing the project on its merits according to the Design standards as if work has not yet occurred. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The Standards (New Construction for Residential Buildings, Materials page 6.18, #1 and #6) call for traditional brick/mortar colors that are unpainted for brick used in new construction. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Chair Parati’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: DENIED 1 st : BARTH 2 nd : BELL 

Mr. Barth moved to deny this application for alternative brick as it does not meet our Standards for building materials, 6.18, number 6 and the Secretary of Interior Standards 2.5 and Section 5.5 and 5.6. The Commission is requiring the applicant come back with a new application referencing the previously approved submittal. The brick should match the original in color, size, texture, and scale. 15
