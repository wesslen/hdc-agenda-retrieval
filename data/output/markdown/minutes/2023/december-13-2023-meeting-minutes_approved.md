With a quorum present, Vice Chair Parati called the December meeting of the Historic District Commission (Commission) meeting to order at 1:06 pm. Vice Chair Parati began the meeting by introducing the Staff and Commissioners and explaining the meeting procedure. All interested parties planning to give testimony – FOR or AGAINST – must submit a form to speak and must be sworn in. Staff will present a description of each proposed project to the Commission. The Commissioners and the Applicants will then discuss the project. Audience members signed up to speak either FOR or AGAINST will be called to the podium for each agenda item. Presentations by the Applicants and audience members must be concise and focused on the Charlotte Historic District Design Standards. The Commission and Staff may question the Applicant. The Applicant may present sworn witnesses who will be subject to questioning by the Commission and Staff. The Applicant will be given an opportunity to respond to comments by interested parties. After hearing each application, the Commission will review, discuss, and consider the information that has been gathered and 2

presented. During discussion and deliberation, only the Commission and Staff may speak. The Commission may vote to reopen this part of the meeting for questions, comments, or clarification. Once the review is completed, a MOTION will be made to Approve, Deny, or Continue the review of the application at a future meeting. A majority vote of the Commission members present is required for a decision to be reached. All exhibits remain with the Commission. If an Applicant feels there is a conflict of interest of any Commissioner, or there is an association that would be prejudicial, that should be revealed at the beginning of the hearing of a particular case. The Commission is quasi-judicial body and can accept only sworn testimony. Staff will report any additional comments received and while the Commission will not specifically exclude hearsay evidence, it is only given limited weight. Vice Chair Parati asked that everyone please silence any electronic devices. Commissioners are asked to announce, for the record, if one leaves or arrives during the meeting. Vice Chair Parati requested that those in the audience remain quiet during the hearings. An audience member will be asked once to be quiet and the need for a second request will require removal from the room. Vice Chair Parati swore in all Applicants and Staff and continued to swear in people as they arrived for the duration of the meeting. Appeals from the Historic District Commission are to the Zoning Board of Adjustment within thirty (30) days from the date of the decision to appeal. This is in accordance with Section 10.213 of the City Zoning Ordinance.

A zoning ordinance text amendment was passed in 2015 to allow the Zoning Administrator to approve true restoration projects that do not meet current zoning setbacks. An application for front porch restoration was reviewed and approved at the administrative level under COA# HDCADMRM-2017-00670 in November 2017. Adjacent properties are multi-family, mixed use, and commercial. The house was designated as a historic landmark in 1982.

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. An updated version of the property survey is needed. The provided survey does not include the front porch. 

2. The elevation drawings and plans provided are from the 1899 plan book. Measured, as-built, architectural drawings specific to the structure that document existing conditions are typically required. 

3. Are there any mature canopy trees on the property? If so, a tree protection plan will be needed, and the location of the trees should be included on a site plan or property survey. 

4. The Commission will determine if the application is complete. 

5. The Commission will determine whether the building has special significance to the Dilworth Local Historic District. With affirmative determination, the Commission can apply up to a 365-Day Stay of Demolition and require a 90-day waiting period to review new construction plans. 9

6. If the Commission determines that this property does not have any special significance to the district, then demolition may take place without a delay or upon the approval of new construction plans.

306 N. Graham Street (PID# 07806401): Constructed c. 1928, the two-story structure is a classic historic commercial building with a storefront on the first level, windows on the upper façade, and decorative cornice. The storefront windows are replacements but the highly decorative brick and cast stone detailing remain intact. 

A one-story brick building with a decorative stepped parapet connects the two-story commercial building with the one-story building located at 420 W. 6 th Street. 

420 W 6 th Street (PID# 07806402): One structure, constructed c. 1950. The building is a one-story, brick building with an American bond brick pattern in the front section, the middle section of the building has a running bond brick pattern, and the rear section of the building is concrete block. The front elevation fronts on N. Graham Street and architectural features include a brick wing wall and large storefront windows that wrap around the right elevation. 

The Commission approved Demolition of the structures with a 365-day stay on March 9, 2022. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is changes to a previously approved project. The Commission approved the new construction of a mixed-used multi-family and commercial building on March 8, 2023. The Approval with Conditions letter is attached.

• Building step-backs have changed. 

• Setbacks have increased along N. Graham Street. 

• An access stair was added between the historic building and new townhomes on N. Graham Street. 18 

• A rooftop use has been added to the historic building on N. Graham Street. The building design along 7 th street has also changed slightly. 

• Along N. Graham the building design changes are mostly to levels 1 and 2 to further given the impression of individual buildings using façade breaks. Some minor alterations have been made to levels 3-7 as well. The grading has also been adjusted. Stoops have been removed from some of the townhome units on N. Graham Street. 

• Minor changes made to the design of the 7 th Street elevation.
