The Commission is a quasi-judicial body and can accept only sworn testimony. Staff will report any additional comments received and while the Commission will not specifically exclude hearsay evidence, it is only given

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMA-2022-00775, 501 N POPLAR ST (PID: 07803623) – NEW CONSTRUCTION, MULTI-FAMILY 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is two-story, duplex constructed c. 1978. Architectural features a flat roof, wide vertical T1-11 siding with a wide trim band separating the first and second levels, vertically oriented windows, a cantilevered front patio with solid vertical sidewalls, and a brick foundation. A covered stair provides access to the second level at the rear. A solid wall in the same material as the house partially encloses the rear yard and provides screening for parking. The lot size is approximately 56’ x 100’. Adjacent structures 2 and 3-story residential structures. On September 14, 2022, the Commission approved the immediate demolition of the building because the applicant intends to recycle, repurpose, and deconstruct as much of the house as possible versus demolishing it. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is the new construction of a multi-family structure. Height is 38’-2” to ridge from finished grade. Setback is 14’-11 ½” to the front porch from back of curb. The front porch is 8” deep. The proposed materials are: 

1. Roof – synthetic shake with cementitious fascia and freeze 2. Siding – “wood look” cementitious lap siding with 8” reveal. Synthetic shingle siding in the bump-out on the left elevation. 

3. Corner boards and trim– smooth cementitious 

4. Front doors – wood with stained glass windows, with cementitious trim 

5. Windows – 2/2 double-hung and fixed, sage colored electro-chromatic glass, cementitious trim 

6. Brackets – cementitious 

7. Porch column and railings – wood 

8. Foundation and front porch steps – thin brick veneer (HDC-018) 

Site features are shown on HDC-011 but most dimensions are not provided. At corner entrance, a stone front patio and double front walk in stone connects the entrance to N. Poplar and W. 8 th Street. A stone water feature is proposed along W. 8 th Street. A wide stone walkway and front patio is proposed for the entrance to the rear unit facing W. 8 th Street. A brick retaining wall, masonry driveway and 6’ tall fence/driveway gate is proposed in the rear yard. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Massing/Directional Expression/Foundation/Roof Forms. Building appears horizontal rather than vertical. Flat roof. Foundation height appears too low for the style of architecture and the street context. 

2. Fenestration 

a. Glass is required to be the most translucent possible. Sage colored or electro-chromatic is not approvable per the Design Standards. 

b. Left elevation: Ganged window proportions and mullion trim dimensions. 

c. Rear elevation: proportions of small windows 

d. Right elevation: proportions and rhythm, including the third level. 

3. Materials 

a. Samples needed for all alternative materials requested. 

b. Brand and thickness needed for proposed siding materials. 

c. Wood trim for windows, doors, corner boards, etc. is typically required for cementitious siding. 

d. Roof material requested has not yet been reviewed by the Commission. 

4. Site features 

a. Dimensions needed. 

b. Stone walkways are incongruous with the Fourth Ward Local Historic District. 

c. Fencing detail needed (staff approvable). 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Chair Parati’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: CONTINUED 1st : GOODWIN 2 nd : BELL 

Mr. Goodwin moved to continue this application for clarification of the setbacks on the drawings, including the thermal wall versus the porch as well as to restudy the roof forms, especially for the third floor to make them more consistent with the historic context (including bringing the third-floor walls and the pool fencing in to make the third-floor elements look more built-in and looking at the height of the eave). Materials were not discussed. This continuation is based on Standards including, but not limited to: Setback 6.5 and Additions 6.23.

Architectural features include a steeply pitched side gable roof with a cross gabled projection and lower front gables, one over the arched recessed entry. Other features include an unpainted brick exterior, 6/6 double-hung wood windows, pent eaves on the gable ends, and an uncovered partial width front porch that originally had a broken terracotta floor. The lot size measures approximately 60’ x 161’. Adjacent structures are a mixture of 1.5 and 2-story residential buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is multi-part. Proposed new windows on all portions of the project are Kolbe Ultra with Simulated True Divided Light (STDL) muntins. 

Part A: Removing an original ganged window on the front elevation, constructing a new bay window on the front elevation, and removing a paired window to add an exterior chimney to the right elevation. There are foundation issues at the left front corner of the building which will also be fixed. Proposed materials include brick/mortar to match existing. The bay window will have 6” wood lap siding, a copper roof, and double-hung wood windows to match existing. See A-4.0 and A-4.1. 

Part B: Removal of a dormer on the right elevation. Add dormers to the left and right elevations, behind the main ridge. The dormers will tie in below the main ridge and will not be taller than the original main ridge. Proposed materials include 6” fiber cement lap siding. The roof over the side entry door will also be extended. See A-4.1, A-4.2, and A-4.3. 

Part C: Roof and window changes on the first level of the left elevation. Remove existing shed roof over entry door and extend the main roof over the entry door. Relocate a window from behind an existing bump out to flank the entry door. Brick/mortar to match existing will be toothed into the window opening. See A-4.1. 

Part D: Right elevation changes include a new addition and new fenestration. A small bump-out addition will be constructed on the first level. The addition is behind the front thermal wall and chimney, not visible from the street. Proposed materials include brick/mortar to match existing. The historic window openings will be shortened, and the windows changed to be casement with tempered glass. New brick/mortar will infill the areas below the shortened windows. See A-4.3.

2. Right elevation window changes, A-4.3. 

a. The pane configuration is incongruous with the existing windows on the house. 

b. The mullion trim is too narrow on the new paired window. 

c. With the exception of the windows flanking the chimney, no original windows are proposed to be retained on the right elevation. 

3. Window detail with trim dimensions needed for fields of siding and brick. 

4. Dormers appear to be coplanar on the rear elevation. 

5. What is the thickness of the proposed fiber cement siding on the dormers? 6. HVAC screening needed to street and neighboring property. 

7. Request a note on the plans to indicate all brick/mortar to remain unpainted.
