With a quorum present, Chair Hawkins called the regular January meeting of the Historic District Commission (Commission) meeting to order at 1:04 pm. Chair Hawkins began the meeting by introducing the Staff and Commissioners and explaining the meeting procedure. All interested parties planning to give testimony – FOR or AGAINST – must submit a form to speak and must be sworn in. Staff will present a description of each proposed project to the Commission. The Commissioners and the Applicants will then discuss the project. Audience members signed up to speak either FOR or AGAINST will be called to the podium for each agenda item. Presentations by the Applicants and audience members must be concise and focused on the Charlotte Historic District Design Standards. The Commission and Staff may question the Applicant. The Applicant may present sworn witnesses who will be subject to questioning by the Commission and Staff. The Applicant will be given an opportunity to respond to comments by interested parties. After hearing each application, the Commission will review, discuss, and consider the information that has been gathered and presented. During discussion and deliberation, only the Commission and Staff may speak. The Commission may vote to reopen this part of the meeting for questions, comments, or clarification. Once the review is completed, a MOTION will be made to Approve, Deny, or Continue the review of the application at a future meeting. A majority vote of the Commission members present is required for a decision to be reached. All exhibits remain with the Commission. If an Applicant feels there is a conflict of interest of any Commissioner, or there is an association that would be prejudicial, that should be revealed at the beginning of the hearing of a particular case. The Commission is a quasi-judicial body and can accept only sworn testimony. Staff will report any additional comments received and while the Commission will not specifically exclude hearsay evidence, it is only given limited weight. Chair Hawkins asked that everyone please turn to silent operation any electronic devices. Commissioners are asked to announce, for the record, if one leaves or arrives during the meeting. 

APPROVED FEBRUARY 8, 2023 Chair Hawkins said that those in the audience must be quiet during the hearings. An audience member will be asked once to be quiet and the need for a second request will be removal from the room. Chair Hawkins swore in all Applicants and Staff and continued to swear in people as they arrived for the duration of the meeting. Appeal from the Historic District Commission is to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. One has thirty (30) days from the date of the decision to appeal. This is in accordance with Section 10.213 of the City Zoning Ordinance.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMA-2022-00524, 1740 MERRIMAN AVENUE (PID: 11909408) – NEW CONSTRUCTION (SF) 

This application was continued from the September 14, 2022 meeting for the following items: 

1. Roof. Per Standard 6.13, numbers 4 and 5, restudy the complexity of the rear roof lines. 

2. Masonry. Per Standard 5.5, number 3, leave unpainted brick unpainted. Submit a brick sample in a traditional color for Commission approval. 

3. Driveway. Per standard 8.2, number 6. Extend the concrete drive to the rear of the building. 

4. Fenestration. Per Standard 6.15, number 1, B and C, restudy of the fenestration to make sure when the sizes are addressed the rhythm is also appropriate. 

5. Cornices and Trim. Per 6.14, number 3, eliminate the pork chop/triangular box eave detail. EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is one-story, American Small House constructed c. 1948. Architectural features include a symmetrical façade with a projecting front gable supported by replacement metal columns, exterior brick chimney and 1/1 replacement windows. The entire house is wrapped in vinyl and aluminum. The lot size is approximately 50’ x 141’. Adjacent structures one-story American Small Houses. The Commission approved the demolition of the building with a 365-day delay on June 8, 2022. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is the new construction of a single-family structure. Height is 20’-6” from finished floor; total height as measured from grade to ridge is unlabeled. Based on the Zoutewelle survey, it appears that the total height as measured from grade to ridge ranges from 21.7’ – 22.4’. Setback is 37’ – 8 ¼” from to front thermal wall, not inclusive of the 6’ deep front stoop. Exterior material is proposed to be brick with the dormers on the second level proposed as fiber cement lap siding with 7” reveal and 4” corner boards. The foundation will be brick with a rowlock. Windows are proposed to be double-hung with Simulated True Divided Lights (STDL) in a 6/6 pattern. Post-construction the rear yard will be 83% permeable. 

Revised Proposal – January 11, 2023 

• Roof design changed on rear elevation (A-4.2) 

• Masonry exterior changed to fiber cement lap siding 

• Fenestration changes. 

o Left elevation. Window “E” beside door, proportions changed to vertical to match other windows (A-4.3) 

o Rear Elevation. Mullion added between paired windows on first-level bump-out (A-4.2) 

o Rear Elevation. Square windows moved away from eave and trim (A-4.2) 

• Cornices and trim design changed 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

# 1. Height as measured from grade to ridge is needed for both left and right side due to topography changes. 

# 2. Foundation height appears too low, particularly on front and right elevations. 

# 3. Details needed: 

# a. Beam/column section from roof to foundation, including column dimensions. 

# b. Window trim detail with dimensions. 

# c. Fiber cement siding. Brand and thickness needed. 

# d. Correct corner board labels and provide material and thickness. Wood trim typically required for cementitious siding. 

# 4. Windows: 

# a. Right Elevation. Proximity of front room window to front corner. 

# b. Window manufacturer specifications not provided but approvable by staff. 

# 5. Minor changes may be approved by staff (Beam/column detail, window trim detail, mullion trim, window size/location adjustments, etc.). 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]:

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Chair Hawkins’ invitation to speak either for or against this application. MOTION: CONTINUED 1st : GOODWIN 2 nd : WHITLOCK 

Mr. Goodwin made a motion to continue this application for the following reasons: Setback, 7.4 - We need drawings to accurately reflect exactly what the setbacks are. For the massing, 7.7 - We need more articulation at the rear elevation to minimize the impact on adjacent residential structures, that specifically applies to the massing on the one side that is planar from ground level to the top of the building. That's all on the contextual criteria. For materials, we specifically addressed the windows, and require the use of the aluminum-clad windows on all the first five levels and that anything above should translate consistency with the rest of the structure per Standard 7.14. In terms of the additional details that need to be provided, note all the comments in the staff analysis. For the windows, we need to see the trim details. All windows proposed for replacement on 306 North Graham Street -- that's the original structure -- restoration details. We need details on the fiber cement siding. Specifically, we are looking for siding that emulates the thickness of standard wood siding. Can be a substitute --cementitious substitute provided as available. I also am seeing here materials and product information, all of those provided for the windows, the storefronts, brick, and mortar. On the proposed site plan, we need a grading plan; we need fences and walls indicated; dumpster and mechanical units, locations of those. And as far as architectural details, railing detail drawing, lighting details, signage details, storefront elevation details, wall section, storefront section. 

Mr. Barth made a friendly amendment; one, requesting that the applicant provide side-by-side comparisons of each iteration on individual slides so they can be reviewed accurately. Number two, requesting that the applicant update their drawings to reflect the supplement agenda items with the open corner site lines on Graham -- 6th and Graham and 7th on the corner of the buildings. And number three, adding to Commissioner Goodwin's talking point for the window acceptance, requesting that clad windows are being accepted up to floor five unless they are on vertically unifying building elements. And also requesting related to that point that the applicant identify on the elevations window types.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI-2022-00587, 1547 MERRIMAN AVENUE (PID: 11909710) - RETAINING WALL, PORCH CHANGES (AFTER-THE-FACT) 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing 1-story American Small House constructed c. 1940. The building has a three-bay façade with a side gable main roof and the right bay is a projecting gable featuring a paired window. Architectural features include a partial width front porch supported by square wood columns, 6/6 windows, interior brick chimney and unpainted brick exterior. The lot size is approximately 50’ x 117’. Adjacent structures are one-story single-family buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

• The proposed project is for changes to a previously approved project. 

• An application was submitted and HDC staff provided the option of going to the Commission to request the proposed stone or to work with staff on a redesign that could be approved at the administrative level. • The applicant selected to work with staff on the project redesign with the project being started prior to the issuance of the administrative COA # HDCADMRM-2021-01088 in March 2022. 

• The project involved the replacement of an existing damaged front concrete walkway, concrete porch steps, sidewalk steps, and a replacement front retaining wall. The approval was for in-kind replacement of the walkway and porch & sidewalk steps, and a new brick retaining wall set back 18” from the back of the sidewalk. The cheek walls for the sidewalk steps were to be faced with a brick layer with a single wood handrail installed for the sidewalk steps. 

• Due to an inability of the applicant to cancel the materials that were already on order, the project was completed out of compliance with the COA in terms of materials. 

• The project is considered an After-the-Fact review, with the Commission reviewing the project on its merits as if work has not yet occurred. 

The stone walls shown in the attached presentation at 1543 Merriman Av, 325 West Blvd, 248 W Kingston Av, 1923 S Mint St, 1523 Merriman Av were installed prior to the establishment of the Wilmore Local Historic District. 1613 S Mint St (labeled as 1600 in the presentation) is an original retaining wall. 1732 Wilmore Dr appears to have been installed in early 2011. The retaining wall shown at 1931 Wilmore Dr was not approved and is an active violation case.
