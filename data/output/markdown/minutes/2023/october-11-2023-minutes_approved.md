bay window, exposed rafters, and 12/1 double -hung windows. The partial width engaged front porch features square 

columns with shake siding ; the right bay of the front porch was formerly infilled. T he lot size is approximately 50’ x 190’.

Architectural features include a side gable roof with pent eaves and a covered side porch on the right side. The front 

entrance has a gabled fr ont stoop with a front door that has sidelights and a transom. The exterior siding is wood

All the window openings are to remain the same in size and location. The original wood trim is to remain. The origi nal 

windows located on the front elevation of the house are to remain.

the Design Standards as if work has not yet occurred. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The existing windows to be replaced are non -original replacement windows.

previously painted brick. The original brick chimney is also previously painted. 

The front entrance has an uncovered painted brick and concrete stoop with painted concrete stairs and w ood handrail. 

The exterior siding is asbestos over original German wood lap siding. The existing windows are 1/1 vinyl replacements 8

with original wood trim. Lot size is irregular, measuring approximately 82 x 113’ x 27’ x 125’. Surrounding structures are 

1, 1.5, and 2 -story single -family buildings.

approximately 4’ -0” into the rear yard. The fo undation will be cement block. A new drainage system will be 

installed due to the grade of the back yard toward the house. The new gable roof will tie into the roof of the 

original house below the ridge with shingles and pitch to match the original house. Install new German lap wood 

siding on the new addition to match the original German lap wood siding on the original house with a wood corner 

board on the right elevation where the addition will meet the original house.

approved and do not require Commission review. 

The project is considered an After -the -Fact review, with the Commission reviewing the project on its merits according to 

the Design Standards as if work has not yet occurred. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The new rear addition is not incongruous with the Standard for Addition (pages 6.24, #1 - #6 and #8) because it 

is located at the rear of the original house and does not visually overpower the existing building and the roof will 

tie into the original roof below the ridge. 

2. Removing existing window opening on the left elevation in remaining existing addition is incongruous with the 

Standard for Windows (page 4.14, For Existing Windows #1, #5, and #6) .

3. Installing a new window opening on a primary elevation ( right elevation) in original house is incongruous with 

the Standard for Windows (page 4.14, For Existing Windows #6). 

4. The replacement of non -original 1/1 vinyl double -hung windows with new 1/1 vinyl double -hung windows is 

incongruous with the Standard for Windows (page 4.14, #10, #18 and #19). 

5. More documentation is needed to determine if rot and deterioration exists to warrant the replacement of the 

original wood window trim. Any new trim should match the original in design, material, dimension, and all 

details (Standard for Trim, page 4.11, #1 – #3). 9

6. Other projects including mechanical equipment with screening, removal of asbestos siding, repair of original 

German lap wood siding on original house, repair of the original wood cornerboards on the original house,

MOTION : APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS 1st : WOJICK 2nd : PARATI 

Ms. Wojick moved to approve the application with conditions as it is compliant with Standards 6.20 -6.24 for additions. 

She stated that the reuse and continuation of German lap siding meets the Standards for materials , but the use of CMU 

does not , asking th at the applicant work with Staff to find a veneer solution that would meet the Standards. She said 

that the Commission encourages the use of vertical boards to separate the new siding from the original and that 

replacement window trim is only installed in locations where the trim cannot be repaired per Standard 4.11. Ms. Wojick 

also cited Standard 4.14, numbers 1, 5, 6, 18, and 19 for replacement windows, adding that vinyl is not permitted, and 

asking the applicant to provide final specifications to Staff. Other Standards cited by Ms. Wojick include 6.18, especially 

numbers 1 for foundations, 2 for siding, and 4 for trim , and Standards 8.6 and 8.7 for fencing. She asked that the 

applicant work with Staff to bring the fence design into compliance , on an appro vable pergola proposal , and the 

replacement of a non -original rear door citing Standard 6.15, number 3. She also requested that the HVAC location and

APPLICATION :

HDCCMA -2023 -00663, 1823 CLEVELAND AV (PID: 12105301 ) – RELOCATION & ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The site includes the former Dilworth Methodist Church South (1829 Cleveland Av) and vacant lot currently used for 

parking. The former church building was constructed c. 1915. Architectural features include a hip roof and domed 

belvedere, round arched bays with fanlights, and rectangular transoms over the front bays. The front elevation has a 

classical portico with a pedimented fanlight gable on massive Doric columns. The exterior is unpainted brick with cast 

stone accents. The existing building measures approximately 34.4’ in height from grade to ridge, and 50.4’ in height to 

the highest point. The lot size is approximately 150 ’ x 1 50’. Adjacent structures are a mix of 1 and 2 story residential and 

commercial s tructures. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project in multiple parts: 1.) the relocation of the c. 1903 Leeper -Wyatt store building from South 

Boulevard to the project site with the setback to match 1829 Cleveland, 2.) rear addition, 3.) rooftop addition, and 4. )

installation of new lighting. 

The only changes proposed to the historic building is the addition of lighting on all elevations. Lighting details are shown 

on Sheet HDC -4. 15 

The Leeper -Wyatt store building is proposed to be demolished under approved “1923 South Blvd Mixed Use” project 

(LDUTOD -2022 -00010). It is a locally designated Historic Landmark and the relocation and proposed additions to the 

building will also require review by the Charlotte -Mecklenburg H istoric Landmark Commission. 

Rear addition for egress stairs: 

• Measures approximately 39’ -5” in height. 

• The footprint measures approximately 23’ -6” x 11’ -2”. 

• Windows will match existing on the original building. 

• A new service entry door will be installed on the left elevation. 

• Proposed materials are brick and mortar to match existing. 

Rooftop addition: 

• The central portion of the rooftop addition begins ap proximately 7’ -8” from the rear of the parapet with the 

main portion of the addition beginning at 22’ -6” from the rear of the parapet. 

• The addition will bring the total building height to approximately 42’ -5 ½”. 

• Proposed materials are a metal and glass st ructure with standing seam metal roof. 

• A metal handrail will be installed behind the parapet. 

Note: This project is specifically being considered due to the relocation of the Leeper -Wyatt store building to preserve a 

designated Historic Landmark. The m oving of the building, the construction of a rear addition and rooftop addition are 

all being considered together to support the relocation of the Leeper -Wyatt Store building. If the project is approved 

and the Leeper -Wyatt Store is not moved to this site, then no portion of the project may proceed and a new application 

for new construction will be required. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The proposed building with the rooftop addition will bring the total building h eight to approximately 42’ -5 ½”. 

This is shorter than the new construction recently approved at 1913 Cleveland Avenue, which measures 

approximately 45’ -4” in height at the front elevation on Cleveland Avenue. 

2. Rear addition 

a. New brick and mortar should be of a color and dimension similar to the existing and remain unpainted 

according to the Design Standards, Masonry 5.5 – 5.6 and Paint 5.8. 

3. Site work: 

a. Will the either, or both, of the original concrete steps and sidewalls be retained? 

b. Will the rolled curb be retained and restored where needed? 

c. Confirm there will be a planting strip between new paving and the building foundation. 

d. Details needed about the property equipment enclosure, which may be Staff approved. 

4. Minor changes may be approved by Staff.
