After hearing each application, the Commission will review, discuss, and consider the information that has been gathered and presented. During discussion and deliberation, only the Commission and Staff may speak. The Commission may vote to reopen this part of the meeting for questions, comments, or clarification. Once the review is completed, a MOTION will be made to Approve, Deny, or Continue the review of the application at a future meeting. A majority vote of the Commission members present is required for a decision to be reached. All exhibits remain with the Commission.

Chair Parati requested that those in the audience remain quiet during the hearings.

This application was continued from the January 11/18, 2023 meeting for the following items: 

• The proposed product does not meet Standard 4.5, numbers 4, 5, and 8. 

• Provide a dimension comparison. Either a physical sample or a dimension drawing comparing the proposed material to the existing material. Provide a sample of the hip detail, preferably a physical sample and how that compares in size and shape to what's existing, and to be able to cite what efforts have been made and where your conclusions have been drawn that we can understand the limitations. 

• Recommend reaching out to specialist. There are societies for different types of roofers and roofing materials, and you may look and find a society. Murr & Laney does a lot of historical work all around -- like they worked on the Biltmore, so they're experts in that. The HDC would take their conclusion as fact to be able to make a decision. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a historic multi-family building constructed c. 1928. According to the National Register nomination, the building appears to be earlier apartments with parapeted sections alternating with forward-projecting tiled hipped roof projections with replacement bays.

e. Provide details about new hardscape material surrounding the pool. 

f. Note on the elevation drawings that the brick foundation is to remain unpainted. 

4. Minor changes may be approved by Staff, including all items listed above. 

MOTION: APPROVED 1ST BARTH 2 ND HAWKINS 

Mr. Barth moved to approve this application as submitted because it is not incongruous with our Standards. The applicant should work with Staff on the following items: that the cedar shingles in the upper section of the gables be individually applied and wood, that the lap siding also be wood and match the existing siding of the historic structure, and that the corner boards and trim to be made of wood and sit proud of the siding. The applicant is also instructed to work with Staff once window and door specifications are obtained. The Commission asks that the applicant adjust the window on the right elevation in the center of the structure to have no divided lite on the bottom sash. Similarly on the front and rear elevation, the two main floor windows should include eight lites over one rather than six over one. The applicant is asked to verify the proposed hardscape material and pool surrounds with the Staff, referencing historic materials were appropriate. The applicant is asked to keep the brick on the foundation unpainted, noting that the brick should be a traditional red color per Standards 6.18 number 6. The applicant is to work with Staff on the pool equipment and HVAC placement and screening, as well as fence details and height per Standard 8.10 number 2 which requires accessory buildings to be compatible with the main house. For fence height, the applicant should refer to Standard 8.7 number 8, and for the pool, Standard 8.4 number 7. Applicant should work with Staff to produce a column detailing that 22 

is similar to the historic structure. The Commission would like a more articulate capital and base detailing mimicking a style similar to the existing house. The Commission will leave it open to the applicant and Staff to figure out whether a brick pedestal and tapered columns are appropriate. For the cedar shingles, the applicant is instructed to follow Standard 5.2 numbers 2, 6 and 8. 

Ms. Hawkins made a friendly amendment that Standard 6.17 number 2 discusses the design the porches and that they should complement the size, proportion, placement, and rhythm of existing historic porches. Ms. Hawkins also noted that Standard 6.17 number 3 offers guidance on appropriate porch column conditions. 

Ms. Lineberger made a friendly amendment referencing Standard 8.9 number 1 for the pool equipment and HVAC site details.
