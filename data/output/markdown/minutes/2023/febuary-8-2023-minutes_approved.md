Commission may vote to reopen this part of the meeting for questions, comments, or clarification. O nce the review is 

completed, a MOTION will be made to Approve, Deny, or Continue the review of the application at a future meeting. A 

majority vote of the Commission members present is required for a decision to be reached. All exhibits remain with the

would be prejudicial, that should be revealed at the beginning of the hearing of a particular case. The Commission is a 

quasi -judicial body and can accept only sworn testimony. Staff will report any additional comments received and while 2

the Commission will not specifically exclude hearsay evidence, it is only given limited weight. Chair Parati asked that

EXISTING CON DITIONS :

The existing structure is a one -story, bungalow constructed c. 1931. Architectural features include a main hip roof with 

a projecting side gable to the right elevation and a front gable supported by brick piers and square columns over a 

partial width front porch. Other features include paired, double -hung 6/1 wood windows, wood lap siding with corner 

boards, and a parged brick foundation. The site retains the original concrete front steps and sidewalls connecting the 

front walk to the public sidewalk. An original accessory building is located at the rear of the lot . Lot size is approximately 

50’ x 195’. Surrounding structures are 1, 1.5, and 2 -story single family buildings. 3

accessory struct ure with a similar configuration and footprint. Proposed materials are traditional to match existing on 

the primary structure, including wood lap siding, double -hung 6/1 wood windows, and wood trim. A 24” hackberry 

growing into the foundation of the existi ng building is proposed for removal. Post -construction rear yard permeability 

calculations are not provided. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Setback on side and rear should be 5’ to the furthest projection (eaves) o f the new building. 

2. Rear yard open space calculations needed. 50% of rear yard, as measured from the back of the original house, 

needs to remain permeable. 

3. Provide a Zoutewelle Streetscape elevation that is legible. 

4. Provide a property section from the front to rear property line as viewed from Southwood. The section drawing 

should include the height of the main house and height of the new accessory building at the elevation facing the

5. Specifications needed (location, size, species) for the new tree to be planted as a replacement for the Hackberry. 

6. Window trim detail with dimensions needed for both single and ganged windows. 

7. Window and door specifications su bmitted to Staff that meet HDC Design Standards.

projecting front gable over the engaged front porch. The front porch roof is supported by a brick pier and square wood 

column and has a tongue -and -groove front porch floor. There is a small, shed roof side addition on the left elevation 4

family h ouse but has since transitioned into a duplex. The original front porch is partially enclosed on the right side, 

with a second front entry added. Exterior materials are wood German lap siding, a painted brick foundation, and 6/1 

double -hung wood windows . The lot size is approximately 50’ x 173’. Adjacent structures are 1 and 1.5 -story residential 

buildings. 

PROPOSAL :

concrete apron. There are 4 options presented with various configurations and combinations of products (asphalt, 

concrete, Latex -ite). The project is considered an After -the -Fact review, with the Commission reviewing the project on 

its merits as if work has not yet occurred. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Refer to Standards for Sidewalks and Parking, page 8.2, #7. 

2. The examples provided on A -1.0 of asphalt parking are either violations, institutional properties, or pre -date the 

designation of the Plaza M idwood district.

request to use non -traditional materials.

dimension drawing comparing the proposed material to the existing material, and a sample of the hip deta il, preferably 

in a physical sample that shows how that compares in size and shape to what's existing . Additional information on what 

efforts have been made and where conclusions have been drawn so that the commission can understand the limitations 

of the potential roof replacement options. Recommending that the applicant reach out to specialists. There are 

societies for different types of roofers and roofing materials that may help with the suggestion to contact Mur r & Laney ,

as they do a lot of historical work and are experts in this field. Their conclusion would be helpful to make a decision .
