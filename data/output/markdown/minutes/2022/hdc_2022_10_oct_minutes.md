APPLICATION :

HDCRMI -2022 -00847, 720 GRANDIN ROAD ( PID# 07102229) - FRONT PORCH CHANGES 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing building is a multi -family Colonial Revival structure known as the Grandin Apartments constructed 

in 1930. The two -story quadruplex has an unpainted brick exterior with a hipped roof. Architectural features 

include decorative ro of brackets, a single -bay front porch supported by paired Tuscan columns and the 

repetition of the bracketed eaves. Original windows are 6/1 and 4/1 grouped; however, some of the windows 

appear to be replacement. The lot size is approximately 53’ x 202’. Adjacent structures are 1, 1.5 and 2 -story 

single -family and multi -family buildings. 

PROPOSAL 

The proposed project is the addition of a railing to the top of the front porch roof. Survey photos from the 

1990s show ghost lines of a former railing. The door providing access to the porch roof suggests that a railing 

would have been original to the structure. The photos from 2014 show that a replacement railing was added 

at some point in a design that is incongruous with the structure. The design of the original railing is unknown, 

so the project cannot be staff reviewed as a restoration and full Commission approval is needed to install a 

new railing since it’s a front elevation change. 

The application is proposing a metal railing, but in email correspondence with staff indicated a willingness to 

use whichever railing material and design is preferred. 

Staff recommends that the new railing be the appropriate historic height, as indicated by the ghost lines in the 

survey file photo, with a booster rail to meet code. Either a wood or metal railing, but not a combination of 

the two materials, is appropriate for the Colonial Revival style of the building. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION 

1. The project is not incongruous with the district and meets the Standards for Porches, 4.8. 

2. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, staff recommends Approval of the project for 

meeting the Standards and that this item be heard as a Consent Agenda item, wit h

permit -ready construction drawings submitted to staff for final review, with the 

following Conditions: 

a. Either a simple metal or wood railing may be used. 

b. The new rail will be at the historic height as indicated by ghost lines in district file photo. 

A b ooster rail may be used to meet code. 

c. Applicant to work with staff on the final design. 

# 3. If requested by a Commission member, or if an interested party has signed up to 

# speak in opposition, then the HDC shall open the application for a full hearing. 

SPE AKERS FOR OR AGAINST :

No one accepted Chairperson’s Parati’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION : APPROVED WITH CONDIITON 1ST : BELL 2ND : BARTH
