Other parties wishing to speak, for or against, will be given reasonable time to present factual sworn testimony based on the HDC Design Standards. The HDC may question the applicant and HDC staff members. HDC staff and the applicant will be given an opportunity for rebuttal and final comments. The HDC shall close the hearing for discussion and deliberation. During discussion and deliberation only the Commission and staff may speak.

The majority vote of the Commission present is required for a decision to be reached. A final vote by the HDC will end the hearing. Chairperson Parati asked that the following guidelines be followed during the meeting; mute your audio when you’re not speaking, use only one source of audio (computer or phone), do not put your phone on hold, make sure you are in a quiet area, turn off or silent electronic devices, and do not speak over the person talking or you will be asked to leave the meeting. Lastly, use the “raise your hand” tool, and please do not speak unless recognized by the Chair or staff.
