PROPOSAL: 

During construction it was discovered that the foundation of the ADU was constructed much higher than shown on the approved plans. The applicant is proposing design changes to the approved ADU due to grade issues. The shed roof slope will be reduced from a 3/12 to 2/12 pitch and material changed from asphalt to standing seam metal. The overall height and relationship to the primary house has also changed. The ADU was approved at a height of 14’-0” from finished floor; 19’ total height from grade to ridge, which is approximately 1’-6” shorter than the primary structure when topography is considered. The ADU height is now proposed to be 21’-10” from grade to ridge and equal to the height of the primary structure. The original presentation and approved plans are attached. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Height as compared to primary structure. 

2. Due to grade issues, the HDC may want to confirm that no other changes are needed to the primary house or site, such as deck height, new driveway, HVAC locations, etc. are needed.
