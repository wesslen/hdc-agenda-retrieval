With a quorum present, Chair Parati called the regular November meeting of the Historic District Commission (Commission) meeting to order at 1:00 pm. She began the meeting by introducing the Staff and Commissioners and explaining the meeting procedure. All interested parties planning to give testimony – FOR or AGAINST – must submit a form to speak and must be sworn in. Staff will present a description of each proposed project to the Commission. The Commissioners and the Applicants will then discuss the project. Audience members signed up to speak either FOR or AGAINST will be called to the podium for each agenda item. Presentations by the Applicants and audience members must be concise and focused on the Charlotte Historic District Design Guidelines. The Commission and Staff may question the Applicant. The Applicant may present sworn witnesses who will be subject to questioning by the Commission and Staff. The Applicant will be given an opportunity to respond to comments by interested parties. After hearing each application, the Commission will review, discuss, and consider the information that has been gathered and presented. During discussion and deliberation, only the Commission and Staff may speak. The Commission may vote to reopen this part of the meeting for questions, comments, or clarification. Once the review is completed, a MOTION will be made to Approve, Deny, or Continue the review of the application at a future meeting. A majority vote of the Commission members present is required for a decision to be reached. All exhibits remain with the Commission. If an Applicant feels there is a conflict of interest of any Commissioner, or there is an association that would be prejudicial, that should be revealed at the beginning of the hearing of a particular case. The Commission is a quasi-judicial body and can accept only sworn testimony. Staff will report any additional comments received and while the Commission will not specifically exclude hearsay evidence, it is only given limited weight. Chair Parati asked that everyone please turn to silent operation any electronic devices. Commissioners are asked to announce, for the record, if one leaves or arrives during the meeting. Chair Parati 

APPROVED JANUARY 18, 2023 said that those in the audience must be quiet during the hearings. An audience member will be asked once to be quiet and the need for a second request will be removal from the room. Chair Parati swore in all Applicants and Staff and continued to swear in people as they arrived for the duration of the meeting. Appeal from the Historic District Commission is to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. One has thirty (30) days from the date of the decision to appeal. This is in accordance with Section 10.213 of the City Zoning Ordinance.

# APPLICATION: 

HDCCMA-2022-00596, 300 East Worthington Avenue (12105618) - New Construction/Relocation 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The site is at the edge of the Dilworth Local Historic District and is a vacant lot. The site slopes from front to rear approximately 8-10 feet. The lot size is approximately 45’ x 140’. Adjacent structures are a mix of 1 and 2 story residential buildings, mixed-use and institutional buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project in three parts: 1.) the relocation of the Leeper Store building from South Boulevard to the project site with the construction of a new foundation for the building, 2.) additions and fenestration changes to the Leeper Store, and 3.) the construction of a new accessory building. The Leeper Store building is a locally designated Historic Landmark and the relocation and proposed alternations to the building will also require review by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmark Commission. Proposed changes to fenestration include the removal of the original storefront and replacement with a new storefront, the addition of storefront windows and an awning to the right elevation, enlarging all first level windows on the right elevation to be the same size as the second level windows, the addition of an open stair along the right elevation, the addition of an enclosed access stair on the left elevation. There also appear to be changes to the rear elevation but the extent of these changes is unclear. 

The new accessory building measures approximately 28’-3” in height as measured from grade to ridge. The footprint measures approximately 28’ x 38’, not including the exterior stair. The design of the windows and doors and the use of brick on the main level is inspired by the Leeper building. 

The project was not heard at the October 12, 2022, meeting due to time constraints. The following sheets have been updated: 

o HDC-1 has an added context map, 

o HDC-3 has updated renderings, and 

o HDC-5 has site adjustments, so the accessory building is completely clear of the alleyway. 

Note: This project is specifically being considered due to the relocation of the Leeper Store building to preserve a designated Historic Landmark. The moving of the building, the construction of a foundation for the moved building at the new site, and the new construction of an accessory structure are all being considered together to support the relocation of the Leeper Store building. If the project is approved and the Leeper Store is not moved to this site, then no portion of the project may proceed and a new application for new construction will be required. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Leeper Store Building 

a. Existing elevations of the structure are needed. 

b. Changes to the original storefront design and loss of original materials, see Secretary of the Interiors Standards. 

c. Clearly label the original windows and openings that are to remain and the window openings to be enlarged. 

d. Details needed about the new awning and how it will attach to the building. 

e. Horizontal and vertical siding materials and dimensions. 

f. Are signage dimensions the same on the front and right elevations? 

g. New brick and mortar should be of a color and dimension similar to the existing and remain unpainted according to the Design Standards, Masonry 5.5 – 5.6 and Paint 5.8. 

2. New Accessory Building 

a. Dormers are coplanar to the first level walls. 

b. Dormers tie into the main ridge. 

c. Eave trim detail needed. d. Architectural details needed, such as the ‘architectural beams’ on the front and rear elevations. 

e. Mullion dimensions are too narrow on ganged windows in dormers. 

f. Siding material and dimension specifications needed. 

g. Pergola detail needed. 

h. New brick and mortar should be of a color and dimension similar to the existing and remain unpainted according to the Design Standards, Masonry 5.5 – 5.6 and Paint 5.8. 

3. Details page, HDC-9 

a. Mullion dimensions shown on window detail “3” are too narrow. 

b. What is in the inset dimension on the brick infill on the faux window detail “5”? 

c. Windows appear to have apron trim on detail “10”. 

d. Manufacturer specifications for proposed new windows and doors, including garage doors. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

Scott Rea, a neighborhood resident, spoke on this application. 

MOTION: CONTINUED 1st : BARTH 2 nd : HAWKINS 

Mr. Barth moved to continue this application for the following items: Requesting that the applicant restudy the historic building to be placed on this site, with regard to spacing and rhythm and setback. Applicant to revisit the historic structure's spacing between it and the southeastern neighbor to the property, allowing for more room; as well as further classification on the spacing providing dimensions down Worthington between each historic structure. In addition, we are stating that we would be more comfortable if the historic structure was closer to Cleveland Avenue. Applicant to provide more setback on the front of the property. Applicant to provide accurate drawings with regard to the structure as it currently stands, providing further detail and plans and elevations; particularly noting door and window locations, architectural details, and materiality. Applicant to provide details for the move to occur and contingency plans should any damage, further damage, occur to the structure and its architectural elements, referencing Chapter 7 in the design guidelines. 

We are holding off on commenting on other items until this study is performed but would like to reference staff notes in the memo for the additional items and more detailed information. We would also like to reference Secretary of the Interior's Standards 2.5, items 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 10 for rehabilitation and request that the applicant maintain historic openings on the existing structure.

This application was continued from the July 13, 2022, meeting for the following items: 

1. Revisit the height of the ADU as it relates to the primary structure, per Standard 8.10, numbers 3 and 7. 

2. Provide a further study of the impact of both the alley and the driveway pavements, vis-a-vis curb cutouts, per Standard 8.2. 

3. Provide a clearer understanding of project meets the Tree Protection Plan (TPP) guidelines, per Standard 8.5. EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The property is an American Small House with Colonial Revival elements constructed in 1946. Architectural features include a symmetrical three-bay façade with a central entry portico, central chimney, 8/8 double-hung wood windows, and a decorative cornice. The shutters are appropriately sized for the windows. Materials are painted brick with wood siding in the gable ends. Lot size is approximately 68 x 130 x 42 x 154. Adjacent structures are 1, and 1.5 story single-family structures. The lot is located at the edge of the Wilmore local historic district abutting the Wilmore Walk Townhome development which is located outside of the district. A rear addition to the primary structure and the construction of a new Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) accessed from the alley was previously approved by the Commission on January 27, 2021, under application number #HDCRMA-2020-00479. 

PROPOSAL: 

During construction it was discovered that the foundation of the ADU was constructed much higher than shown on the approved plans. The applicant is proposing design changes to the approved ADU due to grade issues. The shed roof slope will be reduced from a 3/12 to 2/12 pitch and material changed from asphalt to standing seam metal. The overall height and relationship to the primary house has also changed. The ADU was approved at a height of 14’-0” from finished floor; 19’ total height from grade to ridge, which is approximately 1’-6” shorter than the primary structure when topography is considered. The ADU height is now proposed to be 21’-10” from grade to ridge and equal to the height of the primary structure. The original presentation and approved plans are attached. 

Revised Proposal – November 9, 2022 

• Design changed to one-story 

• Front elevation height at W. Worthington is approximately 17’-11 ½” 

• Rear elevation height at property line with neighboring parcel is approximately 12’-11 ½”, due to site topography 

• New walkway requested 

• Skylights proposed on rear elevation 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Accurately labeled plans with legible dimensions and notes are needed. Labels are cut off. Clarity on East elevation (both right and left elevation labeled as East). 

2. Rear elevation: skylights should be flush mount. 

3. Side elevations: fenestration. 

4. What are the footprint measurements of the proposed structure? 

5. ADU setbacks are measured to the furthest projection (eaves), not the foundation as shown on the site plan. 

6. Does the ADU adhere to the Zoning square footage limitations? 

7. How will the parking area shown be accessed? 

8. Window/door specifications needed. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

Justin Bell, a neighborhood resident, spoke on this application. 

MOTION: CONTINUED 1st : WOJICK 2 nd : HAWKINS 

Ms. Wojick made a motion to continue this project with the following requirements: Requesting permeability calculations for the property. Requesting notes to reflect flush-mount skylights. Requesting window fenestration to be addressed on the left elevation of the ADU. Requesting the footprint measurements of the proposed structure, but also requesting the width of the existing main house. Requesting the ADU setbacks to be documented on the site plan from the eaves, not the foundation. Request the square footage be documented on the plans so we know that it adheres to the ADU zoning requirements. Confirmation of use for a parking pad or not for the ADU structure. Request window and door specifications. The continuation of this project is based on the uniqueness of lot and its location within the neighborhood. Per Standards 8.10, number 3, and number 7. Mr. Goodwin made a friendly amendment; applicant to provide tree protection documentation on the big tree in the back.

• Height between the main house and the ADU. Provide dimensions of the tallest ridge line to grade on the main house, dimensions from all the ridge lines and grade on the ADU to ensure the ADU is secondary to the main house. If a change in height is needed, there could potentially be impacts to the complexity of form, roof forms, design of the ADU, so the Commission did not comment on the complexity of form, etc. 

• Per Secretary of the Interior Standards, 9 and 10, and 6.20, numbers 1 and 3. The transitional board between the diamond and traditional shingles to be at least an inch and a half. Approving the use of diamond shingles in this specific application because it is not visible from the street, terminates at an interior corner that is separated from the rectilinear wall, is a historic material, and is not incongruous with the curved wall on the rear elevation that is not visible. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS:

Architectural features include a front gable roof with a six-light fixed window flanked by vents, engaged front porch supported by tapered wood columns and brick piers, small side gable bump outs on both the left and right elevations, a wood shingle exterior, and painted brick foundation. There is a hipped roof, brick, one-bay historic garage located in the rear. The lot size is approximately 50’ x 223’. Adjacent structures are a mixture of 1 and 1.5-story residential buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is a rear addition of heated living space, removal of an existing one vehicle garage and construction of a new accessory building, and site work, including retaining walls. The existing historic accessory building will be demolished. The new rear addition steps out from the original right corner of the house and steps out on the left elevation slightly in front of the original left rear corner. The new roof of the addition ties in beneath the original ridge. Changes to windows are proposed on the left elevation. The garage portion of the new accessory structure will be accessed from the rear alley. Height is noted at 20’-7 5/8” for the new accessory structure. Lot topography slopes slightly upward toward the rear of the lot.

MOTION: CONTINUED 1st : BELL 2 nd : BARTH 

Ms. Bell made a motion to continue this application, providing additional context. I think the commission agreed that the work that was done was really good, a step in the right direction, but recognizing the conversations we had about residential, also the back rendering, to provide additional either step-back or context to the building (i.e., scale, massing, setback, rhythm and spacing) so just continuing all of that, per Standard 7.2. Also, moving forward make sure all iterations of the designs are included so the commission may look at how the design and the context is evolving. New iteration to include the survey. Lastly, we are not including design detail, material selection, etcetera, in this motion. Applicant to continue to work with staff and review staff’s analysis via the staff memo.
