APPLICATION: 

HDCRMA 2021-00660, 704 WALNUT AVENUE (PID: 07102136) – ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a 1-story Cottage built c. 1929. Architectural features include a side-gable roof with two front-facing cross gables, the smaller of which shelters the projecting central entry bay, 6/6 double-hung wood windows, and an open side porch connected to an open front porch. The house appears to be wood lap siding with beveled corners, siding wrapped in aluminum and has masonry details (foundation, interior chimney, entry bay). The lot size is approximately 55’ x 150’. Adjacent structures are a mixture of 1, 1.5, 2-story residential buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is a rear addition. The addition is a cross-gable with a small rear bump-out. The addition extends the original ridge with the new gable on the right elevation tying in below the ridge. On the left side the addition bumps out approximately 7’-11’ and on the right side it bumps out approximately 4’-4 ¾”. Materials will all match existing including the wood siding, window/door/roof trim, vents, and brick pier foundation. Both rear corners of the original house are covered up at the main level; however, a unique solution being proposed is through the foundation treatment to distinguish between the original house and the addition. The new foundation is brick piers which allows the original house foundation to remain visible, including the original rear corners of the house. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Provide a window trim detail with dimensions. (staff approvable) 

2. Provide manufacturer specifications that meet HDC standards for the new windows. (staff approvable) 

3. The rear elevation photo shows a large tree along the right property line, is the tree still there? If so, needs added to existing site plan. 

4. Provide size/species of any new trees to be planted to replace those being removed due to construction of the addition. (staff approvable) 

5. Provide rear yard permeability calculations. 

6. Minor changes may be reviewed and approved by Staff. 16

HDCRMI 2021-00506, 607 N. PINE STREET (PID: 07807311) – SIDING/FRONT PORCH STAIR REPLACEMENT 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing property is a 2-story Victorian building with classical elements constructed c. 1900. Architectural features include a unique asymmetrical roof, classical elements include the round porch columns, and eave returns, a unique oval window, a wrap-around front porch, Victorian trim around the front door, and 1/1 windows. The lot size is approximately 45’ x 78’. Adjacent structures are a mixture of 1, 1.5 and 2-story single family houses and a 2-story historic commercial structure. 

PROPOSAL: 

The project is in three parts: 

1. Replace the existing vinyl siding with Hardie fiber cement siding. There is no evidence of the original wood siding beneath the vinyl. 

2. Replace the cedar shingles on the front 2nd story using a different pattern (fish scale). 

3. Install brick stairs for the front porch, to replace the existing wood stairs. Per the applicant the stairs were originally cement and it is unclear when the stairs changed to wood. 

STAFF ANAYLISIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 17 

1. The original house was constructed with shingle siding and wood lap siding, see HDC archive photos from the 1970s and 1980s. 

2. If original lap wood siding is found when the vinyl siding is removed completely, then that siding should be repaired and new wood siding toothed in to match existing per Design Standards, Rehabilitation of Building Elements, Wood, 5.2 #7, 8, and 9. 

3. Any original trim elements that were removed during previous work should be reinstalled, such as the trim piece between the first and second floors on the front elevation (see 1980s Rehabilitation before photo). 

4. Siding and trim details and dimensions questions. 

a. What are the Hardie specifications? Artisan is no longer available, regular Hardie has not been approved due to dimensional qualities not matching those of traditional wood siding. 

b. How will the new siding relate to the existing window/door trim? 

c. Will corner boards be used?
