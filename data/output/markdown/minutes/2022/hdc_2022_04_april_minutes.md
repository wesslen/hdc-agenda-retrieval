The existing site is a vacant lot. The former structure was a Colonial Revival 1.5-story single family house constructed in 1951. Demolition of the house was Approved with a 365-Day Stay at the February 13, 2019, HDC meeting (HDCRDEMO-2019-00009). An application for new construction at this site was Denied in March 2021 for the project's scale, height (32’-1”), width (53’+ open porte cochere), rhythm, massing, and foundation, a spacing and setback (32’-7”) exhibit, design feature review, landscape and tree protection plan, material data or specifications, and review of the guidelines referencing spacing, rhythm, massing as it responds to the context of the street. An application for new construction at this site was Denied in October 2021 for the proposed project’s spacing, rhythm, massing and form, setback (44’-6”), design conformity, fenestration, height (28’-4”) and width (56’-7”), roof form, and the Secretary of Interior’s Standards numbers 9 and 10. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal includes the construction of a primary structure and accessory building. 

1. The proposed primary structure has a height of 34.4” at its tallest point as measured from grade to ridge, according to the Zoutewelle Survey (SP2.1/SP3.0). 

2. The total house width is approximately 65’-6 ¾. 

3. Setback to front thermal wall, at the closest point, is 40’-6”. 

4. Setback to front porch edge is 39’-4” and 39’-10” to the roof. 

5. Proposed siding materials are gray brick, fiber cement faux-grain wood lap siding, nickel gap siding. Proposed windows are aluminum-clad with either a 5/8” traditional or putty profile with cast stone sills. Roofing is asphalt shingle and standing seam metal. 

6. The proposed accessory building with a height of 23’-9”. Materials are proposed to be the same as the main structure. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Spacing/Context and the rhythm of the street 

a. The house is located very close to both side yard setbacks, appears especially close to 723 Mt. Vernon. 

2. Massing, height, width, roofs 

a. Houses on the street that have similar heights are vertical in form and narrower in width. 

b. Need clarity on height. The Zoutewelle survey shows the tallest point as being 34.4’ (SP2.1/SP3.0) but the elevation drawings (A2.00) show the total height at 33.5’. 

c. Houses on the street that have similar widths are linear in form and shorter in height, or the main massing of the house is square with one-story wing(s) adding to the overall width. 3. Front Elevation 

a. Large expanse of roof. 

b. Metal roof on the front elevation. 

c. Beam/column alignment on front porch. 

4. Left Elevation: 

a. Fenestration and rhythm. 

5. Accessory Structure: 

a. Need clarity on height. The indicated grade line appears to be placed higher than foundation/grade shown on drawing (see East and Rear elevations). 

b. Rear elevation lack of fenestration. 

c. Beam/column alignment. 

d. Garage door appears to be a double-door; need materials specifications. 

6. Materials + Details: 

a. Fiber cement siding with faux wood grain proposed; no manufacturer name or specifications provided. Faux wood grain has not been approved by the Commission. 

b. Window details, design, dimensions for individual and ganged windows for both fields of siding and masonry. 

7. Site Plan 

a. HVAC screening needed 

b. Details about the hot tub, swimming pool, retaining wall, and other site features are needed.

MOTION : CONTINUED 1 st : HENNINGSON 2 nd : GOODWIN 

Mr. Henningson made a motion to continue this application with the following points: Front Porch - provide more historic column/beam detail on the porch, per standard 6.17, number 2. Materials - no faux grain cementitious wood siding. The applicant should use wood unless they can find a cementitious product that matches the dimensions we require, i.e., matches the actual dimensions of wood that's common on a Tudor house, per standard 6.18, number 2. Metal Roof - the metal roof on the porch is considered appropriate because it does have a low-sloped porch roof, and a low-sloped roof is not incongruous with the Tudor architecture, it’s also pre-finished, per standard 23 4.5, number 5 and number 8. Siding – requesting the applicant come back to us with mockups and samples of the brick. Sample should include ones of their choice as well as a traditional brick that is lighter in color. Also requesting a vertical siding sample and restudy. Applicant to bring back a different option or provide precedence of the vertical siding on the front elevation. Impervious area – requesting a restudy or confirm the calculations of the impervious area in the rear yard. Accessory Structure – requesting a little more information on the actual height, the material specifications for the garage doors, more information on the beam and column alignment, as well as reviewing and adding fenestration to ensure that there's no big, long, blank walls. Mr. Barth made a friendly amendment requesting the applicant to bring samples of the metal roof showing the proposed color and a connection detail selection.
