MOTION : DENIED 1 ST : HENNINGSON 2 ND : WOJICK 

Mr. Henningson moved to deny this application because it does not meet the Design Standards for New Construction, and Additions. For Additions in Chapter 6 the addition violates 6.20 number one, it is not minimally visible from the street. Number two, the size of the addition visually overpowers the existing house, number three, the addition is not attached in a manner that it could be altered or removed in the future. The essential form and integrity of the building would be unimpaired. Number five, the existing roof pitch is not maintained, and number six the design of the addition is not compatible with the existing building. Standard 6.1, context, the addition transforms the house from an American Small House with some Colonial revival accents to a full-on colonial revival house, losing the original architecture of the house. Massing, per Standard 6.1, number one and two the front dormer is too large and doesn’t relate to the simplistic form of the original house. The massing of the addition is essentially adding second story to a low-ceiling American small house. The height per Standard 6.9, number one, the height should not be taller than any other historic buildings in the immediate context. The tallest historic house is 21.8 feet, and the new height of the addition brings the height up to 28.9 feet almost a ten-foot increase in height. Scale, Standard 6.10 the relationship of the building to others around it. The house is fifty percent taller and appears to be over double in size of the original house. Directional expression, Standard 6.11, number one the addition is transforming the house from horizontal in nature to square in nature. Roof forms and material, Standard 6.13, number one through four, the roof forms that increase in the addition are not historic and does not use scale reducing techniques. The front dormers are a scale reducing technique, however, the way the dormers are employed on the front adds to the massing. Per Standard 4.10, number one, features should be repaired not replaced. Standard 4.11 number one through three, adding new crown trim to all existing windows in the house is not historically appropriate, does not fit in the context. Fenestration should be replaced with something that was originally there six-over-one pattern and lastly, brick veneer should not be applied to the existing foundation per Standard 6.15 for fenestration, and Secretary of Interior Standards 2.5, two, three, one, four, five, six and seven.
