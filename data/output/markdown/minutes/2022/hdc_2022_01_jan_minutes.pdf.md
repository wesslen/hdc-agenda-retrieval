APPLICATION: 

HDCRDEMO 2021-010902, 611 W. PARK AVENUE (PID: 11909609) – DEMOLITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing one-story Bungalow constructed c. 1931. The building has a three-bay façade with a front gable main roof. Architectural features include a partial-width front porch with a front gable, supported by replacement metal columns on parged and painted brick piers. The house has been wrapped in vinyl and aluminum. All the doors and windows are replacements. The lot size is small measuring approximately 74’ x 66’ x 74’ x 55’. Adjacent historic structures 1 and 1.5 single family buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is full demolition. The applicant is proposing to reconstruct the building to match existing proposed in a separate application, HDCRMI-2021-00234. 

The owner/applicant planned to save and rehabilitate the building, demo/rebuild the deteriorated front porch, and build a new addition, see HDCRMI-2021-00234. The project was heard at the October and November HDC meetings and the addition was “Approved with Conditions.” At the November 10, 2021 HDC meeting, the front porch rebuild request was “Continued” for additional documentation. 

A professional engineer evaluated the front porch and for project-planning purposes also evaluated the rest of the original structure. 

• The engineering report found the front porch was not original and failing due to a previous repair consisting of concrete blocks and metal beams supporting pieces of corrugated metal roofing, over which poured concrete was added to create the front porch floor. 

• The report also found extensive termite damage, water damage, previous fire damage, and a nearly complete lack of foundation in some areas with the main building merely sitting on single masonry course and small mound of dirt. The areas of brick piers and curtain wall that remain are not structurally sound. The entire foundation needs to be re-built. To do so, the building will need lifted, and a new foundation dug out; however, due to the structural issues lifting the building is not feasible. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 

1. The project has met the required documentation standards for demolition: 

a. Clear digital photos of all sides of the building 

b. Clear digital photos of significant architectural details + site features including, but not limited to, windows, front door, brackets, columns, trim 

c. Stamped and sealed property survey with setbacks + building dimensions (width, length) clearly labeled 

d. Zoutewelle survey 8

2. While the structure does meet the special significance standard due its year of construction, the structure is unsalvageable and waiving all the 365-day delay period is recommended, per Standards for Demolition, page 9.2, number 2. 

3. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, staff recommends Approval of the project for meeting the Standards (Demolition, 9.2, number 2) and that this item be heard as a Consent Agenda item, with the following Conditions: 

a. Demolition may take place the sooner of the approval of new construction plans or the expiration of 365-days, 

b. The 90-day waiting period for the submission and consideration of new construction plans is waived, 

c. Any salvageable, original materials (such as siding) should be retained and reused in the new construction. 

4. If requested by a Commission member, or if an interested party has signed up to speak in opposition, then the HDC shall open the application for a full hearing. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak for or against this application. 

MOTION: APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS 1 st : BONAPARTE 2 nd : WALKER

The original paneled front door with fan light, front door surround with fluted engaged pilasters, and 16 

original 8/8 and 6/6 windows remain intact. Adjacent structures one-story American Small Houses. The lot size is approximately 50’ x 236’.

The proposed project is for a small rear addition that appears to tie in beneath the original ridge.

Material of the new addition is brick to match existing brick. New windows on the addition are proposed to be Windsor Pinnacle aluminum clad with 4/4 Simulated True Divided Lights (STDL) and wood trim. The small patio and fire pit in the rear yard is eligible for Administrative review. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Is there a drawing error on the elevations related to the roof design of the addition? 

a. On the right elevation the new gable roof appears to be slightly taller than the main 

ridge. 

b. On the left elevation and rear elevation, the roof is shown as all the same height. 

2. Front porch columns appear to be original and should remain as is. The design of the proposed trim is not historically accurate. 

3. Right elevation – window configuration on the addition. 

4. With clear direction, staff may approve changes to the window configuration on the right elevation. Other minor changes may be reviewed and approved by Staff.
