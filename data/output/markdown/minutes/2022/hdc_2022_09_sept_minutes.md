An HDC member may request the hearing to be opened for further questioning. The HDC will craft a motion for Approval, Continuation, or Denial. The majority vote of the Commission present is required for a decision to be reached. A final vote by the HDC will end the hearing. Chairperson Parati asked that the following guidelines be followed during the meeting; mute your audio when you’re not speaking, use only one source of audio (computer or phone), do not put your phone on hold, make sure you are in a quiet area, turn off or silent electronic devices, and do not speak over the person talking or you will be asked to leave the meeting. Lastly, use the “raise your hand” tool, and please do not speak unless recognized by the Chair or staff. Because the Commission is a quasi-judicial body any speaker FOR or AGAINST an application must be sworn in.

During the hearing Chairperson Parati will further open the floor to anyone who has joined the meeting by telephone. Speakers will begin by stating their name and address.
