EXISTING CONDITIONS

The project is a brick retaining wall and metal fence along the side yard which exceeds the height standards in the HDC Design Guideline, Section 8.6.8. A stop work order was issued due to the height of the brick column top, which exceed 6 feet. The applicant is requesting an exception for the height of the columns and fence along the wall. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION 

The HDC will determine if an exception should be granted for the height of the wall and fence. 

FOR/AGAINST: No one accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak either FOR or AGAINST the application .

MOTION: Based on non-compliance with Charlotte Historic District Design Guidelines Ms. Titus made a 

MOTION to DENY this application for its failure to meet our guideline 8.6 number 8, fences and walls. The guideline states that rear fencing may be a maximum of six feet in height as measured from the outside at grade. On corner lots on residential streets, privacy fences in rear yards must be screened with appropriate landscaping materials on the public side of the fence. This fence exceeds six feet at all points. The columns are nine to ten feet tall. The grade was altered without permission to require a higher retaining wall. No CofA was ever issued. There is insufficient space on this corner lot to provide the appropriate landscape screening required by our guidelines.

For instance, if a street is primarily Colonial Revival style houses with simple massing, do not introduce a new building with a complex massing. 

 6.5 # 2, Use forms for new construction that relate to the forms of the majority of surrounding buildings. For instance, if the form of adjacent buildings has a variety of projecting bays, dormers, etc., employ some of these elements in the new building. 

 6.10 #1, Roof form and Materials, Use roof forms, such as gable or hipped, or combinations of forms in the design of new residential buildings that relate to existing surrounding examples. 

 6.10 #2, Consider employing roof dormers if they are commonly used in nearby historic houses. The style of the dormer should relate to the style of the house  6.10 #3, Reflect the pitch and gable orientation of surrounding historic buildings in the design of a new dwelling. For instance, if the context is primarily gable-roofed houses, avoid a shallow hipped roof. 

 6.10 #4, Proportionally, the new roof should not overwhelm the structure or be out of scale for the style of the house. 

 6.10 #5, Use eave design and materials that complement those frequently found in the block where the new building is being constructed. 

 6.10 #6, Match new roof materials with materials used in the context of the new building. 

 6.11, Cornices and Trim, Historic buildings in Charlotte’s historic districts have a variety of applications of cornices and decorative trim. These elements are used to define eave and cornice lines of roofs, articulate areas of openings, and siding on walls, create porch elements, and define the edge of a wall and foundation. 

 #1, Take cues from historic buildings on the appropriate use of trim to articulate the 

design of a new building’s style and elements. 

 #2, Ensure that the proportion and scale of the trim relates to the scale and proportion of trim on historic buildings within the context of the new building. 

 6.12, Doors and Windows, The size, proportion, rhythms, pattern and articulation of door and window openings help to give a building its individual style and character. The ratio of solid wall to voids created by openings also gives a building its particular style. 

 There is a wide variety of style and character of these openings within buildings in the historic districts. Studying these elements of doors and windows of existing buildings, within the context of the proposed new design, will help better define what might be appropriate treatments for a new building. 

 Bring precedents from the existing building windows for mutton spacing and then other gothic precedents to support the east elevation as described at the beginning of this motion.
