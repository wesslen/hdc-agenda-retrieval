A majority vote of the Commission members present is required for a decision to be reached. All exhibits remain with the Commission. If an Applicant feels there is a conflict of interest of any Commissioner, or there is an association that would be prejudicial, that should be revealed at the beginning of the hearing of a particular case. The Commission is a quasi-judicial body and can accept only sworn testimony.

APPLICATION: HDC 2017-742, 601 W. KINGSTON AVENUE – NEW CONSTRUCTION 

The application was continued from February for the following: 

 Revise the fenestration pattern on the side elevations of both buildings 

 Revisit the massing of the Worthington Avenue Building 

 Provide a window sample and brick and mortar sample 

 Provide a section showing the HVAC placement 

 Provide material note on garage doors. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS 

The structures are multi-family buildings constructed in 1959; Zoning is R-22 Multi Family. All structures are two stories, clad in brick, with central porticos. Adjacent buildings are single family residential. The HDC placed a 365-Day Stay of Demolition on the entire property on July 12, 2017. 

PROPOSAL 

The project is Phase 1 which is the construction of townhomes on one side of West Boulevard and townhomes facing West Worthington Avenue. Setbacks are parallel to the street. Building heights vary depending on topography. Primary materials are brick and stone. Detail materials are wood clad windows, metal balcony railings, cast concrete, and wood trim garage doors. Walkway location reflects the ROW setback required by NCDOT. 

REVISION – FEBRUARY 

 Building names (on the buildings) have been revised.  Massing of the second building at the corner of West Kingston and West Worthington has been revised to appear as four individual town houses. 

REVISION – MARCH 

 Window and door changes have been made on side elevations of Building 1 (West Boulevard), and all sides of building 2 (West Worthington) as a result of revisions to the elevations (massing). 

 A typical wall section with the HVAC location has been included. The units will be screened by the parapet wall and not visible from public streets. 

 Additional material notes have been provided on exterior doors and locations of Hardie trim (soffit, balcony trim). 

 Center units will share a roof line with the end units stepping down. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION 

1. Regarding the revised elevation which shows the center two units being in the same plane and the two end units stepping down, the Commission will determine which design option best meets the guidelines for massing and fenestration for Building 2 overall, either option for Building 2 meets all guidelines for New Construction. 

2. The non-traditional trim material as noted may be allowed on new construction. 

3. HVAC screening is shown on the plans. 

4. Staff believes the proposal meets the guidelines for new construction. Minor detail changes may be reviewed by staff as recommended by the HDC.
