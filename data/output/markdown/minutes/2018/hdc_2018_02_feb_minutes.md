With a quorum present, Chairman Haden called the regular February meeting of the Charlotte Historic District Commission to order at 1:03 pm. He began the hearings portion of the meeting by introducing the Staff and Commissioners and others. He explained the meeting procedures: All interested parties planning to give testimony – FOR or AGAINST – must submit a form to speak and must be sworn in. Staff will present a description of the proposed project to the Commission. The Commissioners and the Applicant will then discuss the project. Audience members who are signed up to speak either FOR or AGAINST the application will be called to the podium for each agenda item. Presentations by the Applicants and audience members must be concise and focused on the Charlotte Historic District Design Guidelines. The Commission and Staff may question the Applicant. The Applicant may present sworn witnesses who will be subject to questioning by the Commission and Staff. The Applicants will then be given an opportunity to respond to comments by interested parties. After hearing each application, the Commission will review, discuss, and consider the information that has been gathered and presented. During discussion and deliberation, only the Commission and Staff may speak. The Commission may vote to reopen this part of the meeting for questions, comments, or

clarification if necessary. Once the review is completed, a MOTION will be made to APPROVE, Deny, or CONTINUE the review of the application at a future meeting. A majority vote of the Commission members present is required for a decision to be reached. All exhibits remain with the Commission. If an Applicant feels there is a conflict of interest of any Commissioner, or there is an association that would be considered prejudicial, that should be revealed at the beginning of the hearing of a particular case. The Commission is a quasi-judicial body and can only accept sworn testimony. Staff will report any additional comments received and while the Commission will not specifically exclude hearsay evidence, it is only given limited weight. Appeal from the Historic District Commission decision is to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. One has sixty (60) days from the date of the decision to appeal. This is in accordance with Section 10.213 of the City Zoning Ordinance. Mr. Haden asked that everyone please turn to silent operation any electronic devices. Commissioners are asked to announce, for the record, if one leaves or arrives during the meeting. Mr. Haden said that those in the audience must remain quiet during the hearings. An audience member will be asked once to be quiet and the need for a second request will require removal from the room. Mr. Haden swore in all Applicants and Staff and continued to do so throughout the meeting as others arrived.

APPLICATION: HDCRMI 2017-00706 318 WEST 10 TH STREET – WINDOW REPLACEMENT .

This address is one of the 10 th Street Condominiums in the Fourth Ward. The project is a row of three story units build in 1981. This request for replacement windows in one unit was recently deferred for additional context information. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS 

A Stop Work Order was issued when vinyl windows were seen being installed. Owners did not realize that replacement windows being replaced with ones that look the same would be an HDC issue. 

Proposal 3

Approval for the vinyl sash kits is being requested based on the deteriorated condition of the removed windows and the fact that the condominiums are from 1981. The pattern matches what was existing. The owners report that a number, if not all, of the homeowners have already replaced their windows (if not more than once but twice) with vinyl in the 10 th Street Condominiums. Additional information is included which shows pictures of adjacent units. The trim remains with no intention of removing or modifying it. 

APPLICANT COMMENTS 

Owners report that the HOA is in full support of this application and had a letter for evidence. 

FOR/AGAINST : No one accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak either FOR or AGAINST the application. 

MOTION: Based on no exception warranted to Charlotte Historic District Design Guidelines ,

There is infill new construction, two story townhomes (not in the historic district) to the rear, and a row of one story homes across the street (these are in the historic district).

There is a grade change and several trees in various condition on the lot. A previous application was DENIED in September of 2017. This application for New Construction was recently CONTINUED for further design study regarding the front dormer located behind the chimney and material application. It was also recently noted that the right elevation and the front elevation do not speak the same architectural language. 

Applicant Comments 4

DECISION: REDEVELOPMENT CONTINUED. 

APPLICATION: HDCRMA 2017-00683 409 RENSSELAER AVENUE – ADDITIONS. 

This is a c. 1930 one story house on Rensselaer. It backs up to recently demolished, scattered duplexes on property owned by the City which will be redeveloped into mixed use and park space. Additions are planned to take advantage of the new rear view. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS 

This house is listed as a Contributing structure in the Dilworth National Register Survey. It has a small front stoop, the grade drops significantly from front to rear. 

PROPOSED 

A new full front porch and an increase of the roof plane by two feet are proposed to be added. The rear will become two stories over the existing basement. 

Applicant Comments 6

Architect Allen Brooks explained the proposal. This house is mid-block and sits farther back than others in the block. It is a relatively narrow house with little opportunity to expand to the sides. It will become neither higher than the adjacent houses nor higher than the average on the block. It will have a little more than a one foot rise. An upper balcony on the rear will have a small roof covering. The existing daylight basement will become living space by adding windows in the tall crawl space walls with a porch above. The additions step in from the sides. A shed roof is proposed for the front porch. The front yard parking will be removed by extending the drive which would curve to the side of the house to protect a large crepe myrtle in the corner of the yard. All vinyl will be removed and siding will be repaired or replaced to match what is found beneath the vinyl. Windows that have been replaced already will be removed and all new windows will match the original windows on the house. 

FOR/AGAINST : No one accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak either FO R or AGAINST the application. 

MOTION : Based on the need for further design study, Ms. Stephens made a MOTION to CONTINUE the application with revised drawings to consider keeping the unique asymmetry of the front porch, and a restudy of the back porch and the back porch massing, 6/6 windows shown.
