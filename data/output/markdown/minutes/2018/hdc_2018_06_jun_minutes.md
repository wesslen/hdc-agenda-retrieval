He began the meeting by introducing the Staff and Commissioners and explaining the meeting procedure. All interested parties planning to give testimony – FOR or AGAINST – must submit a form to speak and must be sworn in. Staff will present a description of each proposed project to the Commission. The Commissioners and the Applicants will then discuss the project. Audience members signed up to speak either FOR or AGAINST will be called to the podium for each agenda item. Presentations by the Applicants and audience members must be concise and focused on the Charlotte Historic District Design Guidelines. The Commission and Staff may question the Applicant. The Applicant may present sworn witnesses who will be subject to questioning by the Commission and Staff. The Applicant will be given an opportunity to respond to comments by interested parties. After hearing each application, the Commission will review, discuss, and consider the information that has been gathered and presented. During discussion and deliberation, only the Commission and Staff may speak. The Commission may vote to reopen this part of the meeting for questions, comments, or clarification. Once the review is completed, a MOTION will be made to Approve, Deny, or Continue the review of the application at a future meeting. A majority vote of the Commission members present is required for a decision to be reached. All exhibits remain with the Commission. If an Applicant feels there is a conflict of interest of any Commissioner, or there is an association that would be prejudicial, that should be revealed at the beginning of the hearing of a particular case. The Commission is a quasi-judicial body and can accept only sworn testimony. Staff will report any additional comments received and while the Commission will not specifically exclude hearsay evidence, it is only given limited weight. Appeal from the Historic District Commission is to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. One has sixty (60) days from the date of the decision to appeal. This is in accordance with Section 10.213 of the City Zoning Ordinance. Chairman Haden asked that everyone please turn to silent operation any electronic devices. Commissioners are asked to announce, for the record, if one leaves or arrives during the meeting. Mr. Haden said that those in the audience must be quiet during the hearings. An audience member will be asked once to be quiet and the need for a second request will be removal from the room. Mr. Haden swore in all Applicants and Staff, and he continued to swear in people as they arrived for the duration of the meeting.

DECISION: ADDITION CONTINUED. 

MS. HINDMAN WAS NOT PRESENT FOR THIS NEXT APPLICATION. 

APPLICATION: HDC 2018-093 – 224-226 W. KINGSTON AVENUE – NEW CONSTRUCTION 

The application was continued from March for the following items: 

• 6.2, Setbacks – Relate the setback of any new construction and additions to the setback of the existing historic buildings in the immediate surrounding. 

• 6.3, Spacing – Space new construction according to the historic precedent in the immediate surroundings of the proposed new construction. 

• 6.6,#1 - Height and Width – the relationship to height and width of buildings in the project surroundings 

• 6.7, Scale - the relationship of the building to those around it and the human form 

• 6.8, Directional Expression - the vertical or horizontal proportions of the building as it relates to other buildings. 

• 6.9, Foundations – the height of foundations as it relates to other buildings in the project surroundings • 6.12, Doors and Windows – the placement, style and materials of these components. 

• 6.14, Porches – as it relates to the stylistic expression of the proposed building and other buildings in the district. 

• 6.15, Materials – proper historic materials or approved substitutes. 

EXISTING CONTEXT 

The four properties are one story structures that were re-used for a day care; existing zoning is R-22 Multi-Family. The buildings are connected with heated space. 236 West Kingston Ave. was constructed in 1923 and connected to 232, 228 and 224 were also connected to make one building. They were constructed in 1936 and 1940 respectively. A 365-Day Stay of Demolition was approved by the HDC September 13, 2017. Adjacent structures are commercial and single family (one story) on the block. Across the street are single and multi-family buildings. The historic multi-family building at 241 West Kingston Avenue was constructed in 1949, the height is approximately 32’ measured from grade. Its adjacent single family house (245 West Kingston Avenue) was constructed in 1954, approximate height is 33’. The single family house at 251 West Kingston Avenue was constructed in 1936 with a pre-Historic District rear addition height of approximately 40’. 

PROPOSAL 

The proposal is new construction of townhouses on the four parcels. The project is in the rezoning process to a more urban residential district. Front setbacks reflect the existing setback of 236 West Kingston Avenue at approximately 40’. Site features include an 8’ side yard and fence along the single family side and 10 foot buffer behind the alley easement in the rear yard. Existing and proposed trees are noted on the site plan. 

Building heights are approximately 40-45 feet. Materials include cementitious siding and soffits, applied stone on columns and foundation, and wood handrails. Fenestration patterns and material palette vary per individual townhouse unit on the front elevations. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION 

1. The project meets the guidelines for setback, spacing, orientation, directional expression and size. 

2. Staff concerns include the contextual criteria of massing (side and rear elevations), height, scale, foundations, roof form, cornices and trim, windows, porches, materials and rhythm. 

FOR/AGAINST: Kelsey Mayo, Adjacent property owner, spoke in opposition of this application. 

Dennis Mayo, Adjacent property owner, spoke in opposition of this application. 

MOTION: Based on non-compliance with Charlotte Historic District Design Guidelines, Ms. Titus made a 

MOTION to DENY this application for its failure to meet guidelines: 

• 6.6 – Height - the relationship to height and width of buildings in the project surroundings. Proposed 38 to 43 feet in height from grade. This does not meet the historic height of 241W Kingston across the street which is the historic multifamily building that this must be compared to. This building should not exceed 32 feet from grade which is the tallest building in a 360 degree angle. 

• 6.9, Foundations - The height of foundations as it relates to other buildings in project surroundings. Per the Zoutewelle survey, the foundation height of the proposal is two feet, and it does not reflect the historic foundation height of the two historic homes which are adjacent to the property. 

• 6.7, Scale - The relationship of the building to those around it and the human form. The rear of the buildings do not relate to the surrounding structures. 

• 6.2, Setback – In relationship to setback of immediate surroundings. The buildings are 16 feet closer to the street than the adjacent historic properties on the block, on this side of the street. This does not make it within ten percent of the historic setback of the adjacent structures. • 6.4, Orientation – The direction of the front of the building as it relates to other buildings in the district. The orientation of the front entrance does not face the street as required by our guidelines.
