under a gable roof supported by square brick columns. Other features include side gable roof, wood Dutch lap siding with wood 

shingles in the gables, and wood brackets. All brick on the house is painted (foundation, porch columns, chimney). A rear ad dition

District. A Notice of Violation (NOV) was issued by Code Enforcement in 2016 for the stockade -style wood fence, and compliance is 

being worked through with staff. 

Proposal 

The proposal is for replacement of non -origin al windows in the original portion of the house. The windows in the 2010 rear addition 

are vinyl. The windows in the original portion of the house are single -pane 1/1 wood replacement windows. The applicant 

proposes to install vinyl sash -kit replacement windows in the original portion of the house to match those in the rear addition. All 

original wood window trim will remain. The proposal also includes changing a triple window on the left elevation to a set of French -

doors. The original window trim will remain where possible.

historic district.
