• Precedent for the use of a fiber cement product coplanar with the wood product. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure is a two-story bungalow constructed in 1946 with a major addition (2007) that pre-dates the designation of Wilmore as a local historic district.

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing building was originally a one-story Craftsman bungalow constructed c. 1915. Architectural features include a hip roof, front gable dormer, central chimney, and engaged partial-width front porch supported by paired wood columns. Exterior materials include a brick foundation, lap siding with mitered corners and 6/1 double-hung wood windows. A second story hip-roof addition has been constructed. Lot size is approximately 50’ x 150’. Adjacent structures are 1, 1.5, and 2-story residential buildings. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposal is window changes on the right elevation. Based on new kitchen layout and design, two existing windows are to be replaced and one to be relocated. The original historic window will be replaced with new window unit that matches all details of existing windows – number of lites, size of exterior casing, size and thickness of windowsill, sill horn extensions, and upper header trim and drip cap. The new window will have insulated glass. The new window will be a Jeld-Wen wood window similar to the windows on the second level addition. The second existing window is not original. This 16 

window will be replaced with matching new window as described above and will be shifted farther back towards the back yard to accommodate the location of new stove / range between the two new windows. Due to the location of the work, and that the proposal includes replacement of an original window, full Commission review is required.

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure is a one-story, American Small House with Colonial Revival elements constructed c. 1936.

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project has multiple elements, including: 

1. Repair/restoration of the front porch to include removal of the screen system and installation of new wood fluted columns to match the front door surround. 

2. Rear addition that raises the ridge 2’-4”, due to lot constraints that prevent the addition from being completely one-story. The addition is differentiated from the original structure through the use of different materials (stucco). The floorplans shown on A-8.0 illustrate the addition best. It steps in from the right rear corner and there is a one-story bump-out on the left elevation. Materials are traditional to match existing with brick on the first level, stucco on the second level and wood trim, columns, details, etc.

HDCRMI 2021-00043, 516 E. KINGSTON AVENUE (PID: 12308414) – TREE REMOVAL 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure 1.5-story Craftsman bungalow constructed c.1915. Architectural features include both a steeply pitched side gable roof with triangular brackets, an engaged front porch with round columns on brick piers and a shed dormer. Siding material is wood lap with cedar shake on the gable ends with a painted brick foundation. Lot size is approximately 50’ x 140’. Adjacent structures are 1, 1.5, and 2-story single-family and multi-family buildings. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is the removal of a mature Walnut tree located in the front yard near the driveway and the public sidewalk. The Certified Arborist’s report does not indicate any health issues with the tree, which does not allow staff to approve removal at the Administrative level. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Recommend that the size of the new large maturing canopy tree(s) is 2-3” caliper. 

2. Minor changes may be approved by staff, including tree replanting plan. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST] :

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak either For or Against this application. 5

MOTION : APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS 1st : HADEN 2nd : BONAPARTE 

Mr. Haden moved to approve the removal of the tree in question and that it be replaced with a three to four-inch caliper tree more central to the space in the front lawn. The existing tree stump be completely ground out to include all major roots, and that all due care and long-term maintenance for the new tree be committed to by the property owner to ensure that this tree grows. The tree species to be one from the City of Charlotte recommended large shade tree list and that the board would like to see something other than a Red Maple. 

This is considered an exception to our normal tree preservation considerations due to the fact that it is proximate to the street, the sidewalk, and adjacent properties. The annual fall of fruit and nuts produced by the tree will continue to increase as the tree continues to mature. Trimming and thinning will ultimately cause the tree to decline.
