APPLICATION: 

HDCRMA 2020-00708, 1628 WILMORED DRIVE, (PID: 11909601) – ADDITION/ACCESSORY BLDG. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :5

The existing structure is a one-story, front-gabled Bungalow constructed c. 1931. Architectural details include a full-width front porch supported by brick piers and tapered columns, 6/6 double-hung wood windows, wood brackets, and Dutch-lap wood siding. The parged brick foundation and chimney are painted. The front door and a few windows on the left elevation are replacements. A non-original rear addition was constructed prior to the creation of the Wilmore Local Historic District. Lot size is 63’ x 150’. Surrounding structures are 1 and 1.5 story single family buildings. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is an addition to the primary structure and the construction of a new one-story accessory structure on a corner lot. An existing rear addition will be removed, and a new rear addition will be constructed. All materials are proposed to match existing including siding, trim, windows and foundation. New foundation is proposed to be parged and painted to match existing. Post-construction rear yard impermeable coverage will be 35%. 

Per the applicant, the garage placement was determined by the fall of the land. The grade drops from the rear property line to the back of the house. If the garage doors were to face the rear property line, a retaining wall at the boundary and a larger concrete pad would be required for turning radius, which would cause functional problems. Spruce Street has no homes that front it. All homes on this block front either Wilmore Drive or Merriman Avenue. The garage doors facing the Spruce Street will not interfere with the front of any other homes. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

1. The project is not incongruous with the district and meets guidelines for Additions, page 7.2 and 

Accessory Buildings, page 8.9. 

2. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, staff recommends Approval of the projects, with the 

recommendation that hardware on the garage doors be added to make them appear as two-separate doors, for meeting all Guidelines and that this item be heard as a Consent Agenda item, with permit-ready construction drawings submitted to staff for final review. 

3. If requested by a Commission member, or if an interested party has signed up to speak in 

opposition, then the HDC shall open the application for a full hearing. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

Ms. Missy Eppes, neighborhood resident, spoke against this application. 

MOTION: CONTINUED 1 st : LINEBERGER 2 nd : HADEN

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMA 2020-00471, 1141 LINGANORE PLACE, (PID: 12310406) – ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The property is a 2-story Picturesque Revival/Chateauesque building constructed c. 1930. Architectural features include high hip roof center section, lower front gable projection to one side, one-story wing on the left elevation, a semi-circular, conically roofed central tower, metal windows, slate roof, and a massive multi-flue brick chimney. Lot size measures approximately 109’ x 180’ x 133’ x 194’. Adjacent structures are 1.5-, 2- and 2.5-story single family buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is multi-part which includes 1.) a side and rear addition to the main house, 2.) construction of a carport attached to the main house 3.) construction of a new garage and pool house structure in the rear yard, and 4.) Landscape and site changes including a new 12’ wide concrete driveway, cobblestone auto court, a new 5’-6’ tall brick wall along the entire right property line to the street, and extending the existing brick walk to the street, and a new concrete slab in front of the former garage space. 

Garage measures approximately 14’-9” in height. The tallest point of the garage/pool house is on the front elevation of the garage. The copper panel on the front elevation brings the height to 16’-6”. The pool house is approximately 11’-2’ with a 13’-0” copper panel facing the interior of the lot. 

The one-story wing on the left side of the main house, existing carport structure, and the existing driveway will be removed. The swimming pool is existing, approved administratively under COA# 2016-173. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Carport. Blank wall facing the street. The relationship of the gable end design of the carport, specifically the appearance of the half-timbering seems incongruous to the historic house. The location of the carport in the side yard and its connection to the main house creates the appearance of a structure double the width of the original, historic building. 

2. Addition to Main House 

a. Roof forms of the proposed two-story addition. The one-story wing to be removed has a hip roof proportional to the main house. 8

b. On the rear addition, the use of different roof forms may help to differentiate the rear addition from the historic house. The new two-story addition proposed to replace the one-story wing on the left elevation is visible to Linganore and reads as part of the main house. Ahip roof is recommended to be more in keeping with the roof forms of the historic house. Aside gable metal roof appears to be incongruous with the roof shapes on the front elevation. 

3. Site Features: 

a. Driveway 

i. Along Linganore driveways are typically not curvilinear but configured at right angles perpendicular to the street. 

ii. Driveway widths are historically narrower than 12’. 

iii. Tree protection plan needed for tree by the driveway. 

b. Brick wall run along the entire right property line ending at the street in the front yard is incongruous with Linganore and this section of Dilworth. 

c. Existing carport is in poor, dilapidated condition and removal may be approved at the staff level. 

d. Concrete slab should not be run up to the foundation on the right elevation. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

Mr. & Ms. Phil & Jana Harston, neighborhood resident, spoke against this application. 

Ms. Jill Walker, neighborhood resident, spoke against this application. 

MOTION: CONTINUED 1 st : BARTH 2 nd : LINEBERGER 

Mr. Barth moved to continue this application requesting for a restudy the addition as it applies to guidelines section 7.2, numbers 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. The driveway not to include a roundabout, as well as, the carport and the accessory structures in the back of the property guideline’s section 8.2 number 5 and 6. The applicant to provide additional information for painted brick on the original structure, guidelines 5.5 number 3, as well as, some material that will support the painted brick for the commission to review at the next submission. An existing versus proposed site plan showing remaining versus added elements, existing photos of the original house, and a streetscape. Documentation of the window condition for the steel windows being removed and potential for 3D imaging showing massing, but not required. We would like to see a tree protection plan for the trees to remain.

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is one-story, front-gable Craftsman bungalow constructed c. 1930. Architectural features include 8/1 and 6/1 double-hung wood windows, a full-width front porch supported by square (painted) brick piers and square wood columns, wood brackets, and German-lap wood siding. The brick foundation is unpainted. The lot size is approximately 50’ x 86’. Adjacent structures are 1 and 1.5-story single-family residential structures. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is the replacement of a double-hung window on the right elevation with a smaller awning window. Per applicant exhibits the window appears to be deteriorated. The proposed new window will be wood with Simulated True Divided Lights (STDL) in a pattern to match existing. The project requires Commission review due to location and visibility. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The Commission will determine if the proposed replacement window and trim, where required, 

meet the Guidelines.

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a 1.5-story Bungalow constructed c. 1925. A major addition has been added to the rear under old guidelines. The original portion of the house features clipped gable roof and a full-façade front porch supported by round columns. The original carport has been converted to an enclosed porch. The property also retains its original rolled curb at the sidewalk. Lot size is irregular and measures approximately 75’ x 117’ x 93’ x 190’. Surrounding structures are 1, 1.5, and 2-story single family buildings.
