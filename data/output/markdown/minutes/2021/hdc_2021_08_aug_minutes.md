The project also includes a new dormer on the right elevation behind the chimney. A rear entry door will be changed to a window. Proposed materials are brick/mortar to match existing with stucco dormers to match an existing dormer on the rear elevation that is to remain. All trim and architectural details are proposed to match original house details. Windows will be double-hung wood or aluminum clad Simulated True Divided Light (STDL) in a 6/6 pattern to match existing. Post-construction the rear yard will be 8.5% impermeable.
