present factual sworn testimony based on the HDC Design Guidelines. The HDC may question the applicant and HDC staff members. HDC staff and the applicant will be given an opportunity for rebuttal and final comments. The HDC shall close the hearing for discussion and deliberation. During discussion and deliberation only the Commission and staff may speak. An HDC member may request the hearing to be opened for further questioning. The HDC will craft a motion for Approval, Continuation, or Denial. The majority vote of the Commission present is required for a decision to be reached. A final vote by the HDC will end the hearing. Chairperson Parati asked that the following guidelines be followed during the meeting; mute your audio when you’re not speaking. Use only one source of audio (computer or phone), do not put your phone on hold, make sure you are in a quiet area, please turn off or silent electronic devices and do not speak over the person talking or you will be asked to leave the meeting, use the “raise your hand” tool. Please do not speak unless recognized by the Chair or Staff. Because the Commission is a quasi-judicial body, any speaker FOR or AGAINST an application must be sworn in. Due to the hybrid nature of today’s proceedings, any individual wishing to speak for or against an application was asked to sign-up and provide any additional evidence in advance of the meeting. During the hearing Chairperson Parati will further open the floor to anyone who has joined the meeting by telephone. Speakers will begin by stating their name and address. Chairperson Parati swore in all Applicants and Staff and continued to swear in people as they arrived for the duration of the meeting.

PROPOSAL :

The proposal is new construction of a multi-family building located on two parcels at the corner of East Boulevard and Euclid Avenue.

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the comments about the proposal: 

1. The Commission will determine if the proposed project meets the design guidelines for 

new construction. 

2. Height, Massing, Scale, Roof form (pitches appear a bit shallow for the Craftsman style). 

3. Door design – a single sidelight is incongruous. 

4. Additional information is needed about proposed materials. 

5. Landscape plan with required tree replanting is needed. 

6. Site plan with HVAC & trash locations.

A restudy of the front porch details, especially the details around the balcony railing, the roofing, and columns. 

Provide a block site plan showing the new building and the adjacent setbacks of the buildings and positions of the buildings around it. Provide an elevation of East Boulevard three buildings to the right and three buildings to the left for context. Provide dimensions on that block site plan from the thermal wall to the street of the different buildings. With the site plan, provide a tree planting from the previous application. On Euclid Avenue, provide a restudy of the massing, the setback, the roof lines, the scale, and the height, as in Chapter 6, numbers 1.
