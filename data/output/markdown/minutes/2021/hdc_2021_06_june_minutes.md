• The addition has been modified to be a 2-story addition that is no taller and no wider than the existing house but does constitute a more than 50% increase in square footage. 

• A covered rear porch is proposed. 

• Existing windows are to be retained/repaired. New windows to match existing. 

• A new window opening is proposed on the right side elevation and a new door opening is proposed to be added to the left side on the existing house. 

• The front porch addition has been reduced in size. 

• The enclosed left side porch is to be removed and reconstructed in a modified footprint. 

• A rebuild and extension/modification of the eave and fascia are proposed. 

• Plans no longer include the right-side open porch addition, the one-story garage structure and rear yard fencing. 14 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Left Elevation: lack of transition and clear delineation between the original house and the new addition. 

2. Right Elevation: fenestration rhythm on the addition. 

3. Eave alignment on the new addition as compared to the original house. How will the connections occur at the inner corners where the new addition meets the original house? 

4. Front Elevation: alternative materials proposed for porch columns. 

5. A rear yard open space calculation is needed that includes any existing/proposed to remain concrete. 

6. The Commission will determine if the proposed project meets the Design Guidelines for Additions.

This application as continued from the May 12, 2021 meeting for the following items: 

• Restudy for compatibility with Porches, 4.8, numbers 5 and 6. 

5. Enclosure of side porches and balconies is discouraged. If enclosure of a side porch or balcony is required for a new use, the enclosure should be designed to ensure that the historic character and features of the porch are preserved. 

6. Any porch enclosure that is permitted should be designed to be reversible and removal of 

original features should be minimal. 15 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure is a two-story Picturesque Revival with Tudor elements constructed in 1937. Architectural details include a front projecting gable and diminutive gabled dormers, and a one-bay projecting stone entry. Lot size irregular, measuring approximately 75’ x 188’ x 82’ x 154’. Surrounding structures are 1.5, 2, and 2.5-story single family buildings. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is the enclosure of a side porch. The side porch is currently screened. The proposal is to remove the screens but retain the brick foundation, beam/trim, and wood columns and install brick walls between the columns. A set of triple casement windows, to match existing, are proposed for the front and right elevations and an entry door is proposed for the rear elevation. Proposed materials are traditional to match existing. 

Revised Proposal – June 9, 2021 

• Porch infill materials changed to wood 12-light casement windows with wood panels below on the front and right elevations. 

• A clad wood ¾ light door proposed to be installed on the rear elevation. 

• Two options have been provided for the rear elevation; option #1 proposes what appears to be solid wood panels to the right of the door on the rear elevation and option # 2 proposes wood 12-light casement windows with wood panels below to the right of the door, similar to what is proposed for the front and right elevations. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The original elements of the porch are retained: foundation, columns, beam/trim. 

2. The Commission will determine if the proposed project meets the Design Guidelines for Porches, Windows, and Additions. 

3. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff.

APPLICATION :

HDCRMA 2021-00157, 814 EAST BOULEVARD (PID: 12108211) – NEW CONSTRUCTION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The building is a 1.5 story Craftsman bungalow constructed c. 1915. Architectural features include a full-width engaged shed-roof front porch supported by piers and square columns, a central dormer, brackets, shingle siding and double-hung wood windows in 8/1 and 6/1 patterns. Lot size is approximately 66’ x 200’. There is a solid asphalt driveway located to the left of the house and a 10’ alley in the rear. The current structure was approved for demolition with a 365 day stay at the July 8, 2020 HDC meeting (HDCRDEMO-2020-00208). 

PROPOSAL :

The proposal includes the construction of a new structure and connector to the adjacent 820 East Blvd. The proposed new structure is two-stories with a height of 26’-7 ¾”to the tallest point. The building width is approximately 26’-8” with connector that extends further on the left side. Proposed siding materials are wood lap siding with wood trim, wood decorative brackets, wood porch railing with a brick foundation. Proposed windows appear to be a mix of double-hung, fixed, and feature/storefront windows. Roofing is asphalt shingle. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Building Width + Directional expression is too narrow and too vertical. 

• Proposed building appears to be modeled after Foursquare architecture. However, the proposed building appears to be more of a farmhouse with a vertical expression with applied Craftsman elements (exposed rafters, columns, window design). 

• The narrower and taller building results in proportionality discrepancies as visible in the front porch columns/roof height, relationship between the first and second levels, fenestration sizes and locations on the second level. 

2. Front Elevation: 

a. Dormer Roof pitch is very flat. 

b. Railing design. Historically, railings ended at or below the windowsills (note railing at 820 E. Blvd). Recommend that railing be shortened, and simple booster rail added to meet code required height (per HDC railing guidelines). 18 

3. Right elevation, which will be highly visible due to building placement on the lot, is a long, flat expanse. 

4. Fenestration design on the right elevation, including rhythm, locations, and narrow openings with square panes. 

5. Connector: Appears heavy, especially from the front elevation. 

6. Further details are needed for the following: 

a. Setbacks of the new building 

b. Window/door/columns/rear deck materials & details, including a railing detail section 

c. Porch section 

d. Total height/width of connector 

e. HVAC location 

f. Dimensions & materials for site work including driveways/walkways 

g. Reversibility of the connector addition in regard to the historic structure at 820 East Blvd 

7. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

Mr. Steve Hofstatter, neighborhood resident, spoke in opposition of this application. 

MOTION: DENIED 1 st : HENNINGSON 2 nd : WALKER 

Mr. Henningson moved to deny this application based on guideline 6.1 new construction, not enough detail on the setback of the new building, spacing, there is no information on the spacing and the rhythm across the street. The orientation is incongruous with the other houses on the street. The massing, the building's vertical orientation and deep footprint are incongruous with corresponding houses on East Boulevard. The width is too narrow when compared to other houses in the immediate context. From a scale perspective, the heavy connector between the two buildings creates a large scale of a building that does not read as two separate buildings with a light and airy connector. The directional expression is too vertical. The roof form doesn't work. A hip roof on a deep rectangular structure does not work.
