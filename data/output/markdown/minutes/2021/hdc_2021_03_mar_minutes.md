APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI 2020-00743, 2000 CHARLOTTE DRIVE (PID: 12111107) - ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure is a one-story American Small House with Colonial Revival elements constructed c. 1941. The building is a side-gabled brick structure with 6/6 double-hung windows. The front porch roof is a later addition. The addition of a roof and brick chimney over an existing concrete patio was approved by the Commission in September 2018 (HDCRMI-2018-00430). The house height is approximately 20’-2”. The lot size is 55’ x 140’. Adjacent structures are 1-2 story single family houses. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is a rear addition. The addition ridge is offset from the primary ridge on the right side. The addition ridge is approximately 2’-10¾” taller than the primary ridge. On the right elevation (Ideal Way side) a shed dormer will be added. On the left elevation the new addition will connect to an existing one-story side addition. Materials are noted to match existing with wood columns in the same dimensions as existing, and double-hung Simulated True Divided Light (STDL) windows in a 6/6 pattern. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The existing window in the existing one-story bump-out as shown on A-4.0 does not appear to have the correct trim dimensions as-built. Window trim on the addition is drawn correctly but noted to match existing. Clarification needed. 

2. Materials are noted to match existing; however, the existing siding and trim in fields of siding are not specified on the plans. 

a. Clarification on materials that will be used on the addition is needed. 

b. Confirm new brick/mortar will match existing.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI 2020-00722, 251 W. KINGSTON AVENUE (PID: 11907911) – ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a two-story bungalow constructed in 1946 with a major addition (2007) that pre-dates the designation of Wilmore as a local historic district. New wood siding was installed on the front and rear of the house during the 2007 addition. Lot dimensions are approximately 50’ x 170’. Adjacent structures are 1-2 story single and multi-family buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is to replace damaged siding originally installed in 2007-2009 as part of a major addition to the building. The fiber cement lap siding will only be installed on the non-historic addition. No original materials will be changed. The replacement of the non-original, damaged wood shingle siding in the front gable has already been administratively approved (HDCADMRM-2020-00770). 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The Commission has previously approved the installation of non-grain fiber cement siding on non-historic additions and on new, infill construction. 

2. The Commission will determine if the proposed replacement siding and trim, where required, meet the Guidelines. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak for or against this application. 

MOTION: CONTINUED 1 st : HINDMAN 2 nd : HADEN 

Ms. Hindman moved to continue this application for more accurate drawings of exactly what is proposed, including, but not limited to, the shakes at the gable ends, the thickness and exposure of the existing historic siding, the thickness and exposure of the proposed fiber cement siding, and window trim and corner board details that demonstrate that they are thicker than the deepest point of the lap in the siding.Also, show precedent for the use of a fiber cement product coplanar with the wood product. 6

HDCRMI 2020-00702, 429 W. PARK AVENUE (PID: 11908520) – LANDSCAPE & SITE FEATURES 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a 1.5 story Craftsman constructed c. 1931, located at the corner of W. Park Avenue and S. Mint Street. Architectural features include a full-width front porch that wraps around the left elevation, decorative shingles in the gables ends, brackets, and 8/1 windows. Lot size is approximately 85’ x 217’. Adjacent structures are 1-2 story single-family houses. The rehabilitation of the house including window repair, front porch repair, and partial enclosure of the rear porch were approved at the Administrative level (COA# HDCADMRM-2018-00513). The English garden, new walkway, garden path, and firepit were approved at the staff level due to location and materials (COA# HDCADMRM-2020-00637). This is an after-the-fact application and a Stop Work Order (SWO) was issued. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is the addition of landscape and yard features in the side yard adjacent to S. Mint Street including: 

1. Bocce court (10’ x 60’); 

2. Floating deck (24” off ground, footprint 10’ x 20’) with a raised bench at one corner. 

3. Round, brick sand-set patio 

Proposed materials are traditional and include sand-set brick, wood, and crushed stone. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The location of the bocce court and deck in the side yard prevents these projects from being Administratively reviewed/approved. 

2. The proposed projects do not alter historic features and are reversible, which meets Secretary of the Interior’s Standard #10. 

3. All traditional materials are proposed which meet the guidelines requirement for materials. 

4. Screening of the bocce court and deck, particularly from the front elevation along West Park Avenue. 7

Staff Analysis 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Rear Addition + Porch Addition 

• Rear addition should tie in 6” below existing ridge. 

• The site topography appears to slope upward from the front of the site toward the back of the site. Will the rear ridge line be visible above the main ridge due to site topography? 

2. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMA 2020-00501, 628 WOODRUFF PLACE (PID: 07103515) – ADDITION /ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT (ADU) 

This application as continued from the November 18, 2020 meeting for the following items: 

1. Additions, guideline 7.2, numbers 1, 2, 6, and 8. 

2. Site plan. Please provide an accurate site plan that includes the other accessory building on the property. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The property is a two-story Colonial Revival building constructed in 1948. Architectural features include a symmetrical façade, exterior end chimney and quarter-round gable windows. The original windows were 8/8 double-hung but have been replaced at some point. A rear sunroom addition and the enclosed front portion were both installed prior to the creation of the Wesley Heights local historic district. Lot size is approximately 55’ x 150’. Adjacent structures are 1, 1.5, and 2-story single-family structures. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposal is for changes to a previously enclosed front entry and the expansion of the existing one-story sunroom/rear addition. The existing sunroom addition measures 31’ x 14’-8”. The addition will be expanded to two-levels and is proposed to have a footprint of 60’x 25’. The first level will be transformed to an attached, three vehicle garage with living space above. New windows are a mix of casements and double-hung. The enclosed front portico will be reopened. New columns and gable will be constructed. No trees are proposed for removal. Post construction the rear yard will be 33% impermeable. 

Revised Proposal – March 10, 2021 

1. Revised site plan. 

2. Revised addition design, including changes to the existing one-story bump-out. 

3. New Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) proposed. 15 

Staff Analysis 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Front Elevation: Front entry addition design is incongruous with the original house, particularly the brick pier and column combination. Colonial Revival houses do have a pier/column language. The board and batten siding in the front pediment is not stylistically appropriate for Colonial Revival buildings. 

2. Front + Right Elevations: The addition of a second story to the existing one-story wing. Lack of delineation between first and second levels. Window locations and proportions. 

3. Left Elevation: Board and batten siding on the shed dormer. 

4. Rear Elevation: Dormers are co-planer with the first level walls. Use of lap siding on one dormer and board and batten siding on the other dormer. Lack of fenestration on the two-story bump-out. 

5. Accessory Structure: Location, size and massing. Does not appear to be secondary to the main house. 

a. Does not meet required setbacks for Accessory Dwelling Units. 

b. What is the square footage? Accessory dwelling units are limited to 800 sf in size per Zoning. 

6. Window trim on the addition is picture frame. 

7. Materials clarification: 

a. Board and batten siding is incongruous with the Colonial Revival style of the original house. 

b. Is the Hardie siding is the Artisan line? 

c. Window trim detail needed. 

d. Information about proposed material for new windows on the addition. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak for or against this application. 

MOTION: CONTINUED 1 st : HENNINGSON 2 nd : HADEN 

Mr. Henningson moved to continue this application with the following changes: add a tree to the site plan. Porch, per guideline 6.14, number 2, restudy the porch to align with the Colonial Revival style and provide dimensions of the front porch along with a diagram that shows the setbacks for the front porch and the setbacks of the porches and thermal wall of the houses of the neighbors. Massing, per guideline 7.2, number 2, 6, and 8, that discusses limiting the size of the addition on the right elevation. Make the addition one story to better align with the style of the Colonial Revival, and to align with our guidelines for additions on Colonial Revival houses. With the rear addition, a restudy of the massing and ensure that the rear yard is 50 percent permeable as taken from the line on the rear wall of the historic house. Fenestration, per guideline 6.12, number 1, relate window and door openings to the historic house, being mindful of the ratio of solid to void and the rhythm of the windows and door openings for the side and rear addition. Materials, per guideline 6.15, number 1, board and batten is incongruous for additions on Colonial Revival houses. Select a material that's more in keeping with the Colonial Revival style. Garage, per guideline 8.9, number 6, garage doors need to appear separated, and guideline 8.9, number 3, the accessory building must be secondary in width and height to the main house.

HDCRMA 2020-00708, 1628 WILMORE DRIVE (PID: 11909601) – ADDITION /ACCESSORY BUILDING 

This application as continued from the January 27, 2021 meeting for the following items: 

1. Guideline 7.2, numbers 2 and 6. Address differentiation between the new and existing construction. 

2. Guideline 8.5. Provide a site plan and tree location as well as a tree protection plan. 

3. Guideline 6.1, number 5. Address the window and door materials to be used. 

4. Guideline 8.9, number 6. Address the garage door configuration on the detached garage. 

EXISITING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure is a one-story, front-gabled Bungalow constructed c. 1931. Architectural details include a full-width front porch supported by brick piers and tapered columns, 6/6 double-hung wood windows, wood brackets, and Dutch-lap wood siding. The parged brick foundation and chimney are painted. The front door and a few windows on the left elevation are replacements. A non-original rear addition was constructed prior to the creation of the Wilmore Local Historic District. Lot size is 63’ x 150’. Surrounding structures are 1 and 1.5 story single family buildings. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is an addition to the primary structure and the construction of a new one-story accessory structure on a corner lot. An existing rear addition will be removed, and a new rear addition will be constructed. All materials are proposed to match existing including siding, trim, windows and foundation. New foundation is proposed to be parged and painted to match existing. Post-construction rear yard impermeable coverage will be 35%. 

Per the applicant, the garage placement was determined by the fall of the land. The grade drops from the rear property line to the back of the house. If the garage doors were to face the rear property line, a retaining wall at the boundary and a larger concrete pad would be required for turning radius, which would cause functional problems. Spruce Street has no homes that front it. All homes on this block front either Wilmore Drive or Merriman Avenue. The garage doors facing the Spruce Street will not interfere with the front of any other homes. 

Revised Proposal – March 10, 2021 

1. Tree proposed for removal shown on existing site plan. 

2. Tree proposed to be planted shown on proposed site plan. 

3. New French doors specified as wood. 17 

4. New windows specified as wood, double-hung in a 6/6 pattern to match existing. 

5. Garage door details added. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

1. The project is not incongruous with the district and meets guidelines for Additions, page 7.2 and Accessory Buildings, page 8.9. 

MOTION: APPROVED WITH CONDITION 1 st : BONAPARTE 2 nd : HADEN

This application as continued from the January 27, 2021 meeting for the following items: 

• Conduct initial further study of the project's scale, height, width, rhythm, massing, and foundation as it corresponds to the adjacent historic homes and properties on its block within a 360-degree radius, per Guidelines 6.2 and 6.3. 

• Provide an exhibit that shows spacing and setbacks, so the house is visible in context. 4

• Review several design features as it relates to the project overall as a composition in relating back to certain design elements and features seen in the historic district which include siding material, window type and configuration, roof form, roof material, cantilever precedent, etc. per Secretary of the Interior’s Standards, page 2.5 and Guidelines 6.5, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11, 6.12 and 6.15. 

• Provide a site plan indicating existing trees on site, and if the trees are to be removed and retained. Provide a tree protection plan or a reason for removal and evidence to support that per Guidelines 8.5. 

• Provide material data or specifications on windows, precast concrete elements, the pool in the back, the retaining walls, the paver systems, etc. 

• The overall guidelines referencing spacing, rhythm, massing as it responds to the context of the street will need to be reviewed, and this will need to be analyzed before the finer details of the project are approved. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing site is a vacant lot. The former structure was a Colonial Revival 1.5-story single family house constructed in 1951. Demolition of the house was Approved with a 365-Day Stay at the January 16, 2019 HDC meeting. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposal includes the construction of a primary structure and accessory building. The proposed primary structure is two-stories with a height of 32’-1” to the tallest point. The house width is approximately 53’ with an open Porte cochere roof that extends further on the right side. Proposed siding materials fiber cement shiplap siding and wood shake siding with a stone foundation and chimney. Proposed windows are aluminum-clad and curtain wall windows. Roofing is asphalt shingle and standing seam metal. 

The proposed accessory building is 22’-3 ½” at the rear and the front elevation is shorter due to lot topography. Materials are proposed to be the same as the main structure. Windows are on the front and rear elevations; no windows proposed on the side elevations. 

Revised Proposal – March 10, 2021 

• No changes made to the design of the project. 

• Setback exhibit provided. As proposed, the setback of the new house is 32’7”. 

• Front yard tree located on site plan. No information provided about the tree size or protection plans. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The proposed house has a setback of 32’-7” to the front thermal wall which is incongruous with the historic context of Mount Vernon Avenue. Setbacks on exhibit are measured inconsistently. Some measured to front porch others to front thermal wall. Typically, for proposed new construction, the Commission considers both setbacks – thermal wall and porch – as part of its review. 

2. Materials – shiplap siding is incongruous with the existing historic context and the Dilworth neighborhood. 5

3. Details about the hot tub, swimming pool, retaining wall, and other site features are not available and not for review at this time. 

4. The Commission will determine if the proposed project meets the Design Guidelines for New Construction and Accessory Buildings.
