HDCRMI 2021-00256, 1901 THE PLAZA (PID: 08119702) – ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing 1.5 story Craftsman Bungalow constructed c. 1934. Architectural features include 8/1 double-hung wood windows and a full-width front porch with a gable roof supported by paired square wood columns atop stone piers (the single columns atop the piers flanking the front porch steps appear to be later additions). The front porch also features a wide decorative trim band. Exterior features include wood lap siding and an unpainted stone foundation, chimney, and porch piers. The lot size is approximately 66’ x 170’. Adjacent structures 1, 1.5, and 2-story single family and institutional buildings. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is window changes and a rear addition that is no taller or wider than the original house but visible because the house is on a corner lot. 

The new work expands a previous, non-historic rear addition at the rear of the building and a previous, non-historic dormer addition on the right elevation. Proposed materials are traditional to match existing. New windows are proposed to be Jeld-Wen aluminum clad double-hung and casements with Simulated True Divided Light (STDL) in a pattern to match existing. A new exterior chimney in stone to match the foundation and front porch piers on the original house is also proposed. Post-construction, rear yard impermeable area will be 27%. 

On the left elevation of the non-historic rear addition, a non-historic window will be replaced with two salvaged historic windows from the rear elevation. 

On the right elevation, the project includes changing the windows on all sides of a small, non-historic addition. One of the non-historic windows is on the front elevation facing The Plaza so is not eligible for Administrative review. The existing opening will be enlarged and a salvaged historic window from the rear elevation will be installed. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The proposed project appears to meet all standards for Additions, page 7.2 and New Construction, Chapter 6. 

2. Minor changes may be approved by staff.

APPLICATION :

HDCRMA 2021-00258, 1801 MERRIMAN AVENUE (PID: 11909113) – ACCESSORY BUILDING 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure is a one-story American Small House with Tudor Revival elements constructed c. 1945. Architectural features include an asymmetrical façade with a prominent chimney on the front elevation, an arched front entry, a side porch (infilled), and 8/8 ad 6/6 double-hung wood windows. The brick exterior has been painted. A small rear addition appears to have German lap siding and corner boards. The building is on a corner lot with a slightly irregular size measuring approximately 53’ x 141’ x 78’ x 129’. Adjacent structures are 1 and 1.5 story single family buildings. 20 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is the construction of a new Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU). The building is located as close to the rear inside corner of the lot as allowed by required ADU zoning setbacks. At the tallest point the height will be 19’-9”. Due to lot topography changes, the main house measures 20’-10” at the rear and 21’-4 ½” at the front. Proposed materials for the ADU are wood siding and trim. The windows will be aluminum clad in a 6/6 pattern to coordinate with the main house. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Massing, co-planer rear dormer. 

2. Confirm the style of wood siding – lap or German lap? 

3. Garage door design (arch) and material (composite). For street-facing garage doors the Commission typically requires wood garage doors. 

4. Post-construction rear yard open space calculations. 

5. Driveway material and dimensions. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak for or against this application. 

MOTION: APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS 1 st : HENNINGSON 2 nd : BONAPARTE 

Mr. Henningson moved to approve this application based on guidelines, Chapter 8.9 for Accessory Buildings with the conditions: The wood siding should be lap. The garage door should be solid wood. The window detail in the elevation diagrams should match the window cross-section, the window detail. There shouldn't be any window picture frame molding. The door on the front and right elevations should have a 12-light pattern. On the second story, the wall should be brought in six inches, so the second story is not coplanar with the thermal walls on the first story. Staff should review the rear yard permeability calculations, and if there's an issue, the application should be brought back before the commission. 

Mr. Barth made a friendly amendment; the rear dormer is not really a dormer, so it does not need to step back. VOTE: 7/0 AYES: BARTH, BONAPARTE, HADEN, HENNINGSON
