1. The proposed project appears to meet all standards for Additions, Page 7.2 and New Construction, Chapter 6. 

2. Minor changes may be approved by staff.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI 2021-00626, 2001 THE PLAZA (PID: 08119707) – FENESTRATION CHANGE/RESTORATION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a 2-story Foursquare with Craftsman elements constructed c. 1925. Architectural features include a hip roof with a small hip dormer, a one-story side porch that has been converted into a sunroom, and a full-width front porch with a hip roof that extends past the right elevation over an engaged carport. The porch and carport roof are supported by square brick columns. The house retains most of the original double-hung wood windows in a 4/1 pattern. The front door and sidelights are also original with a light pattern that matches the windows. Lot size measures approximately 66’x 170’. Surrounding structures are 1, 1.5, and 2-story single-family and institutional buildings. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project is changing a door opening to a window on the right elevation, second level. It is unclear if the door opening is original but given the location it is highly unlikely. At one point this house was divided into apartments and it is believed that this door was installed for egress purposes. An original, historic window on the rear elevation is proposed to be relocated to the door opening. Brick from the rear of the house will be toothed-in under the window. All materials and dimensions of any new material will match existing. Since the project cannot be proven to be a true restoration, and is highly visible, the project requires Commission review and approval. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 

1. The project is not incongruous with the district and meets Standards for Windows, Page 4.14. 

2. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, staff recommends Approval of the project for meeting all Standards and that this item be heard as a Consent Agenda item.

APPLICATION: 

HDCCMA 2019-00827, 1316 THOMAS AVENUE (PID: 08117305) – NEW CONSTRUCTION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The proposed project site is currently a vacant lot being used for parking. It is located at the edge of the Plaza Midwood local historic district. Lot size is approximately 50’ x 150’. The project was Approved with Conditions at the October 14, 2020 HDC Meeting. A revised front elevation was approved at the January 13, 2021 HDC meeting due to structural and mechanical engineering requirements. 

PROPOSAL: 

The project was approved with a 15% maximum for penetrations (windows/doors) from floor to roof on the right elevation as required by the Fire Code for commercial structures. However, the Code Reviewer has determined that the requirement for this particular lot is 10% maximum for penetrations. The right elevation has been adjusted to meet the 10% Fire Code requirement. 

• The most significant change is to the bay. Originally designed with a triple window, the design has now changed to a slightly shorter single window flanked by permanently affixed shutters. The square window in the gable has been changed to a vent. 

• At the rear, on the second level a double window has been changed to a single window. The window is now centered above the open porch on the first level. 

• The four windows forward of the bay were slightly reduced in size. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 

1. The project is not incongruous with the district and meets standards for Additions, Page 7.2 and New Construction, Chapter 6. 

2. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, staff recommends Approval of the projects for meeting all Standards and that this item be heard as a Consent Agenda item, with permit-ready construction drawings submitted to staff for final review.
