1. The retaining wall material meets the guidelines and takes design inspiration from the main 

house.

4. Concrete cheek walls should not be bricked over with thin veneer face brick, this is a poor 

masonry practice. 

5. The concrete steps and cheek walls are original historic site features and should not be changed 

or removed, per Standard 8.4, #1.

Architectural details include side gable roof with pent eaves, 6/1 double-hung wood windows, and an engaged front porch under a full façade gabled roof supported by slightly tapered square columns on top of brick piers. The primary exterior material is brick with shake shingle siding in the front gable. The lot is shallow and irregularly shaped measuring approximately 50’ x 97’ x 29’ x 55’ x 57’.

STAFF ANAYLISIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Front elevation reversed on neighborhood map, A104. 

2. Massing & Height 19 

• Building is both tall and wide; building seems tall for proposed Craftsman style bungalow. Height reduced but still over 27’. Width is proposed at 45’-11 ½”. 

3. Scale & Foundations 

• Does the foundation, fenestration, etc. line up with adjacent properties? 

4. Windows 

• West elevation – top trim on left side double windows is not visible due to roof overhang. 

• South Elevation – size/proportions on shorter windows. 

• As drawn mullion trim is too narrow between the paired/triple windows throughout; mulls seem to be same size as window trim/casing. 

• 5” casing indicated for window trim; mull trim will need to be increased proportionally; 4” casing is typical.
