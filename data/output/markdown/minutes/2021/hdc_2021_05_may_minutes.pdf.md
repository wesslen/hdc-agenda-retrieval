This application was continued from the April 14, 2021 meeting for the following items: 

• Provide more detail on the right elevation that shows where the new window is being added and situated so that we can evaluate its proximity to the double-paired windows to the right. 

• Per guideline 4.14, numbers 1 and 2, retain and preserve existing windows. The left original window should be kept, repaired, and remain. 12 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing building was originally a one-story Craftsman bungalow constructed c. 1915. Architectural features include a hip roof, front gable dormer, central chimney, and engaged partial-width front porch supported by paired wood columns. Exterior materials include a brick foundation, lap siding with mitered corners and 6/1 double-hung wood windows. A second story hip-roof addition has been constructed. Lot size is approximately 50’ x 150’. Adjacent structures are 1, 1.5, and 2-story residential buildings. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposal is window changes on the right elevation. Based on new kitchen layout and design, two existing windows are to be replaced and one to be relocated. The original historic window will be replaced with new window unit that matches all details of existing windows – number of lites, size of exterior casing, size and thickness of windowsill, sill horn extensions, and upper header trim and drip cap. The new window will have insulated glass. The new window will be a Jeld-Wen wood window similar to the windows on the second level addition. The second existing window is not original. This window will be replaced with matching new window as described above and will be shifted farther back towards the back yard to accommodate the location of new stove/range between the two new windows. Due to the location of the work, and that the proposal includes the replacement of an original window, full Commission review is required. 

Revised Proposal – May 12, 2021

HDCRMA-2021-00009 1541 WICKFORD PLACE (PID: 11908701) – ADDITION 

This application as continued from the April 14, 2021 meeting for the following items: 

• Slide 359, which shows the window conditions. Windows in the front rooms are to be repaired and restored as possible. Sash replacements will be considered pending HDC staff inspection. Any approved sash replacement will match configuration with a five-eighths-inch putty profile. 

• Slide 380, study the dimension and depth between the main and upper floors at the addition. 

• Slide 368, study the truncated upper gable at the addition to complete the geometry. 

• Slide 367, study double columns for visual support of the dormer weight. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure is a one-story, American Small House with Colonial Revival elements constructed c. 1936. Architectural features include fluted pilasters around the front entry, 6/6 double-hung wood windows, and a central brick chimney. The exterior is painted brick. The front porch is partial-width under a shed roof. It was slightly expanded to the left and right at some point and partially enclosed with a screen-system. Lot size is irregular, measuring approximately 82’ x 113’ x 27’ x 125’. Surrounding structures are 1, 1.5, and 2-story single family buildings. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project has multiple elements, including: 

1. Repair/restoration of the front porch to include removal of the screen system and installation of new wood fluted columns to match the front door surround. 

2. Rear addition that raises the ridge 2’-4”, due to lot constraints that prevent the addition from being completely one-story. The addition is differentiated from the original structure through the use of different materials (stucco). The floorplans shown on A-8.0 illustrate the addition best. It steps in from the right rear corner and there is a one-story bump-out on the left elevation. Materials are traditional to match existing with brick on the first level, stucco on the second level and wood trim, columns, details, etc. 

3. Window replacement. Sash-kit only, trim to remain and be repaired.
