the existing house and will be partially visible from the street. Proposed siding material is fiber cement 

board and batten. Post construction the rear yard will be 40.6% impervious. 

STAFF ANALYSIS 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Height + Size + Massing 

a. Footprint dimensions needed. 8

b. Property section needed to show relationship between primary structure and proposed new 

accessory structure. Lot topography unknown, so unclear if the ADU will truly be shorter than the 

house when constructed. 

2. Front Elevation: 

a. Window trim details need adjusted. Windows shown with stand ard trim and an additional 

mullion. 

b. Garage Doors: Appear to be one -large double -door instead of authentically separate doors. 

When visible to the street are typically required to be wood. 

3. Rear Elevation: 

a. Window details of paired windows need adjusted; same note as above for front elevation 

dormer. 

b. Glass proportions - single windows are horizontal instead of vertical. 

4. Right Elevation: 

a. 6x6 wood posts appear undersized. 

b. Beam/column alignment. 

5. Left Elevati on: 

a. Glass proportions of window is horizontal instead of vertical. 

6. Roof: 

a. Dormers are co -planer to first level. 

b. Dormer pitch too shallow. 

c. Do any of the roof pitches match the main house? 

7. Foundation: 

a. Typically, more than a few inches concrete slab is required on the exterior; siding is not usually 

run so close to the ground. 

8. Materials: 

a. Siding material appears incongruous with the primary house. Possibly okay as a feature on 

dormers, but not for the main body of the structure. 

9. Tree protection plan f or the Maple tree is needed .

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST] :

No one accepted Ms . Hindman’s invitation to speak for or against this application. 

MOTION : CONTINUED 1st : BARTH 2nd : GOODWIN 

Mr. Barth moved to continue this application for the applicant to provide accurate dim ensions for the 

ADU addition with relation to its architectural elements as well as dimensions to property lines. The 

applicant to show the ADU relation to the existing house in elevation form to study massing and scale. 

The applicant to provide a tree protection plan for all trees being saved on the property. For the 

materials used on the exterior of the structure , the siding on the main form of the garage should relate 

back to the existing house, as well as the light configuration pattern of the windows relating back to the 

house with a more vertical emphasis. Applicant to provide more details of materials between 

windows, spacing between win dows and their mull configuration, trim on the head, jamb , and the sill 

condition of each window. For the two dormers , the slope side of each dormer should be misaligned 

with (inset from) the thermal wall below by at least six inches .

Ms. Hindman made a friendly amendment a to clarify that the pitches of the ADU roof should be 

relative to the main house roof. 9

Ms. Walker made a friendly amendment to the second request (showing the ADU in relation to the 

existing house in elevation form to study massing and scale), to also add a view from a street 

perspective. Provide m ore clarity on the garage doors appearing to be clearly double, whether they are 

or not. 

To clarify M s. Walker’s friendly amendment, Ms. Hindman stated the Commission is requesting the

topography but also the view from the street.

main massing of the house is square with one -story wing(s) adding to the overall width. 

b. Houses on the street that have similar heights are vertical in form and shorter in width. 

c. Need clarity on height. The indicated grade line appears to be placed higher than 

foundation/grade shown on drawing, A2.00 and A2.01 (possibly a drawing error?).
