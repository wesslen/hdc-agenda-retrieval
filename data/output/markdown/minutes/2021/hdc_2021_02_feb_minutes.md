> HDCRMI

2020-00703, 1716 WINTHROP AVE (PID: 12308409) - ADDITION/ACCESSORY BUILDING 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure is a 1.5-story Dutch Colonial Revival house constructed c. 1920. Architectural details include a front gambrel roof with a full-façade porch supported by reeded square columns, and one-story side gable wings. Lot size is 50’ x 190’. Surrounding structures are 1.5, 2 and 3-story, institutional, multi-family and single-family buildings. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is an expansion of an existing one-story rear addition. Proposed materials are a brick foundation, wood lap siding with mitered corners, wood columns, wood trim and double-hung wood windows to match existing. The proposed roof material is standing seam metal, which is a new material for the building. On the rear elevation, one of the original windows will be moved slightly to accommodate the new second story addition. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Proposed roof form of the addition, particularly the two-story portion. Changing the existing incongruous rear addition is an opportunity to bring the roof forms into greater congruity with the architectural style of the house. 

2. Lack of fenestration on the second level on the right elevation. 

3. Minor changes may be approved by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak for or against this application. 

MOTION: APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS 1 st : RUMSCH 2 nd : GOODWIN 

Mr. Rumsch moved to approve this application with the following provisions: staff review the second story addition and roof, with the gambrel roof reflected on the rear elevation, per guideline 7.2-additions, and the window of the second story conform to more of a dormer look. Staff to approve the location of the second-story window on the gambrel gable per guideline 6.10, #3 and the cottage-style windows on the second floor per guideline 6.12. The side yard elevation blank wall needs fenestration. 4

Ms. Hindman made a friendly amendment, reference guidelines 6.10, #3 for the gambrel roof.

APPLICATION: 

HDCRMI 2020-00707, 933 BERKELEY AVENUE (PID: 12309209) – ACCESSORY BUILDING ROOF, NON-TRADITIONAL MATERIAL REQUEST 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure is a two-story brick Colonial Revival constructed in 1933. Architectural features include one-story side wings, 6/6 double-hung windows, and a classical cornice detail with dentil molding and pent eaves. The lot size is an irregular pie shape measuring 171 x 177 x 71 x 88. The Dilworth National Register Nomination specifically mentions a garage. However, the architecture of the existing carport indicates that it is not an original structure but built more recently to compliment the main house. In March 2020, the Commission approved the addition of a wood frame screen system to an existing rear porch on the main house and a one-story addition to the existing carport under application number HDCRMI-2019-00819. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposed project is a request to install an alternative roofing material, synthetic slate, on a previously approved addition and changes to the carport structure. The main house underwent a major addition in 2003. A new roof to match the existing material asphalt shingle was approved; however, an artificial slate roof was installed instead. The roof material change on the main house was discovered by staff in spring 2020 when the applicant requested to install the same material on the one-story accessory structure. The installation of alternative roofing materials is not eligible for Administrative approval. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. The Commission will determine if the proposed project meets the Design Guidelines for roofs. 

2. Minor changes may be approved by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak for or against this application. 

MOTION: APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS 1 st : HINDMAN 2 nd : RUMSCH 5

Ms. Hindman moved to approve this nontraditional material request based on guidelines 8.9, number 3, 6.10, number 6, 4.5, number 5, the fact that the owners inherited this roof and is not of their own doing on the primary structure, and with the condition a sample is provided to staff for record. 

Mr. Rumsch made a friendly amendment, provide a sample of the material and name of the material along with the specs so we know what we are approving. 

Ms. Parati made a friendly amendment, we are not replacing a slate roof with an artificial slate but instead an architectural shingle roof.

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

Known as the Wadsworth House, 400 South Summit Avenue was the first house built in Wesley Heights. Designed by Charlotte architect Louis Asbury and built in 1911 in the Shingle Style, architectural features include a square mass, hipped roof with hipped dormers, a full-length porch with a Porte cochere, and multi-paned windows. The accessory structure, also constructed in 1911, is a combination carriage house and servant’s quarters which matches the main house in design and materials. Lot size is approximately 195’ x 187.5’. Adjacent houses are one- and two-story single-family structures. A rear addition was approved by the Commission on September 11, 2019 under COA# HDCRMA-2019-00507. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is in three parts: 

1. Siding replacement. The existing siding on both the main house and the carriage house is completely deteriorated, and the applicant has detailed efforts to restore and reuse original shingles in the attached presentation. Proposed product: 3/8” wood shingles to match existing sourced from Waldun Forest Products, British Columbia, Canada. A few well-known historic properties that Waldun has supplied shakes/shingles for include Theodore Roosevelt’s house, Camp David, Edgar Allen Poe’s house and Independence Hall. 

2. Front porch ceiling replacement. The original beadboard ceiling was deteriorated as detailed in the attached presentation. 

3. Removal of access stairs from the front porch to the Porte cochere. The access stairs appear to be a later addition. The porch design will match the left elevation. 6

HDCRMA 2020-00467, 2010 The Plaza (PID: 09506101, 09506131, 09506102) – NEW CONSTRUCTION 

(MULTI-FAMILY) 

This application as continued from the January 13, 2021 meeting for the following items: 

• New Construction, guidelines on page 6.1 and page 2.5 for context. Particularly as the building that fronts The Plaza relates to its context, the street's character including what is located across the street. 

• Look into further development of the building along Thurmond as it pertains to the stepping of the facade and other embellishments around the front door of the individual units. 

• Separate the dormers so that they are true dormers and to provide a continuous cornice line at the second story and to eliminate any material transition at the exterior corners of the dormers. 

• Please note on the plan for HVAC locations that was discussed to be in the roof -- or hidden by the roof parapets 

• The Commission has not evaluated the project for guidelines 6.11 through 6.16 or Chapter 8. The applicant needs to provide details on architectural elements and trim. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The property at 2010 The Plaza is the Van Landingham Estate, a designated local historic landmark. The four-acre property has two accessory buildings with fairly dense landscaping. PROPOSAL: 

The project is the construction of four new buildings that comprise a total of 22 townhomes. 

• Ten (10) units are accessed from The Plaza and face the main house. 

• Twelve (12) units are accessed from Belvedere Avenue and face Thurmond Place. 

• Maximum roof peak is approximately 35’-10”. 

• Proposed material palette is Nichiha Savannah Smooth siding, Miratec (trim), brick, aluminum clad windows with brick mold trim/fiber cement trim. 

• Roof details include wood fascia and brackets 

• Other site features include landscaping, tree planting, and new driveways and walkways. 10 

Revised Proposal – January 13, 2021 

• Site plan with existing conditions and tree save shown 

• Site plan with partial landscape planting plan shown 

• Revised elevations 

• Streetscape with elevations 

• 3-D views 

Revised Proposal – February 10, 2021 

• Height of units fronting The Plaza and Belvedere are 33’-6” 

• Heights of all other units is 35’6” 

• HVAC locations noted 

• Architectural details provided (window trim, brackets, etc.) 

• New 3-D views 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Height/Scale/Context. 

The tallest buildings on The Plaza are two-stories (1501, 2010, and 2100 The Plaza). When comparing these three properties the foundation heights, window header heights, and eave lines all generally align. The other similarity is the roof design. All three properties have hip roofs which recede from the tallest point. The alignment of the roof eaves would be a better measurement to consider when comparing the proposed townhomes to the existing historic structures. Height is one factor that cannot be separated from the overall scale/massing of the individual parts of a building. 

a. Guidelines, page 2.5: “In evaluating a project proposal, the HDC and its staff refer to the adopted design guidelines that are based on the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. They also examine the specific context of the property in question.” 

b. New Construction Guidelines, page 6.1 “Charlotte’s historic districts’ distinctive character is derived not only from architectural style but also from the nature of the street created by building setback, spacing, mass, and height as well as the landscape quality. This street character and the surrounding properties are considered to be the context for any new building. As such, the block in which the new site is located should be carefully studied when designing a new infill dwelling. This context should include both sides of the subject street.” 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak for or against this application. 

MOTION: CONTINUED 1 st : RUMSCH 2 nd : HADEN 

Mr. Rumsch moved to continue this application for a floor plan showing front porches, patios, walks, and the street connection, including the issue with the hedges. A survey of the surrounding elevations of the front features of the surrounding buildings which would include the height, the scale, the context, the foundation, cornices, porches, rhythm, and other site features as described in Chapter 8., A protection plan for any trees and landscaping that need to be protected during the construction process and dimensions put on the drawing so we can understand specific dimensions of roof heights, if they are not displayed.

HDCRMA 2020-00633, 1913 CLEVELAND AVENUE (PID: 12105619) – NEW CONSTRUCTION (MULTI-FAMILY) 

This application as continued from the January 13, 2021 meeting for the following items: 

• The project does not meet the guidelines for New Construction as outlined on page 6.1 regarding massing, roof form, height and width. The motion incorporates all the Commission’s discussion on the project regarding the concerns and desires to see what happens with this building. 

• The Commission has not reviewed any other elements or guidelines including architectural details. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing structure is a one story, concrete block three-bay building. The c. 1960 building mentioned in the Dilworth National Register Nomination burnt down in the early 1990s. The current structure was built in 1993. The building has a shallow gable roof with a front parapet. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is new construction of a multi-family building. The new structure is approximately four stories along Cleveland Avenue and five-stories at the rear of the building, due to site topography. Exterior materials are brick and aluminum clad windows. A partial-width front stoop faces Cleveland Avenue. 

Revised Proposal – February 10, 2021 

• Front elevation redesign with full-width front porch 

• Left elevation design changes 

• Additional cornice and architectural details added to all elevations. 

STAFF ANALYSIS: 

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Height, Massing, Scale, Setback, Spacing, and Roof Forms. 

2. Site plan with the proposed building that includes dimensions – setbacks, porch depth, the depth/length of the bump-outs on the left and right elevations, etc. 

3. Landscape plan with HVAC locations noted. 

4. The building maximizes the entire lot and will be directly adjacent to the existing multi-family structures on Euclid Avenue. 

5. The applicant provided a Zoutewelle survey for E. Worthington; however, the proposed building at 1913 Cleveland is not shown behind it. An exhibit that illustrates the proposed building behind the existing properties on both Euclid and E. Worthington Avenue would help to illustrate the potential impacts to the district and existing structures. 12

Under the qualification that information was not provided, 6.2, setback, 6.3, spacing, 6.4, orientation, 6.5, massing, 6.6, height and width and 6.1, context. 

Ms. Jessica Hindman made a friendly amendment, the Zoutewelle survey giving us information about how all of the big-pictures guidelines are interpreted as one, and cannot be taken piecemeal; and that this particular Zoutewelle exhibit demonstrated that while the height above sea level may be lower than the adjacent building, the height of perceived in the context is taller than the adjacent building because of the space of wall. This incorporates my other comments about Slide 238.
