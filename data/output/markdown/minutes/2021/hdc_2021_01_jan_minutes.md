ABSENT: HENNINGSON 

APPLICATION :

HDCRMA 2020-00633, 1913 CLEVELAND AVENUE (PID: 12105619) – NEW CONSTRUCTION 

(MULTI-FAMILY) 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The existing structure is a one story, concrete block three-bay building. The c. 1960 building mentioned in the Dilworth National Register Nomination burnt down in the early 1990s. The current structure was built in 1993. The building has a shallow gable roof with a front parapet. 

PROPOSAL :

The proposal is new construction of a multi-family building. The new structure is approximately four stories along Cleveland Avenue and five-stories at the rear of the building, due to site topography. Exterior materials are brick and aluminum clad windows. A partial-width front stoop faces Cleveland Avenue. 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Height, Massing, Scale, Setback, Spacing, and Roof Forms. 

2. Front porch depth. 

3. Landscape plan. 

4. The building maximizes the entire lot and will be directly adjacent to the existing multi-family structures on Euclid Avenue. An exhibit that illustrates the proposed building behind the existing properties on both Euclid and E. Worthington Avenue would help to illustrate the potential impacts to the district and existing structures. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST] :

Mr. Rick Cohan, neighborhood resident, spoke against this application. 

Ms. Lucy Raynor, neighborhood resident, spoke against this application. 

Mr. John Fletcher, neighborhood resident, spoke against this application.

MOTION : CONTINUED 1st : HADEN 2nd : BONAPARTE 

Mr. Haden moved to continue this application, because it does not meet our guidelines for new construction 6.1, massing, roof form, height, width. We incorporate all the at-large discussion, regarding our concerns and desires to see what happens with this building [see CLT Planning, Design & Development YouTube Recording: Historic District Commission January 27, 2021 - Special Called 4

Meeting – Timestamp 59:32 for information on the discussion]. We have not reviewed other elements and guidelines. We solely reviewed those guidelines under 6.1 related to overall massing and overall design. We are not reviewing details.

ABSENT: HENNINGSON 

APPLICATION :

HDCRMA 2020-00467, 2010 THE PLAZA (PID: 09506101, 09506131, 09506102) – NEW CONSTRUCTION 

(MULTI-FAMILY) 

This application as continued from the November 18, 2020 meeting for the following items: 

• New Construction, guidelines 6.1 through 6.10 .

o The project must remain secondary to the Van Landingham Estate, and while the Van Landingham is the building inspiration, it must remain the star of the property. There is a need for additional information including the elevations in their entirety with the context of both streetscapes and potentially a 3D model showing it in its context. It is the inter-connectiveness of the guidelines 6.1 through 6.10 as they relate to each other and not one specific guideline. Specific guidelines referenced include: 6.5, number 2; 6.7, number 3; and 6.10. 

o The Commission has not yet evaluated the project for guidelines 6.11 through 6.16 or for Chapter 8, including, but not limited to, tree plan, the hedgerow, or the hardscaping. 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The property at 2010 The Plaza is the Van Landingham Estate, a designated local historic landmark. The four-acre property has two accessory buildings with fairly dense landscaping. 

PROPOSAL :

The project is the construction of four new buildings that comprise a total of 22 townhomes. 

• Ten (10) units are accessed from The Plaza and face the main house. 

• Twelve (12) units are accessed from Belvedere Avenue and face Thurmond Place. 

• Maximum roof peak is approximately 35’-10”. 

• Proposed material palette is Nichiha Savannah Smooth siding, Miratec (trim), brick, aluminum clad windows with brick mold trim/fiber cement trim. 5

• Roof details include wood fascia and brackets 

• Other site features include landscaping, tree planting, and new driveways and walkways. 

Revised Proposal – January 13, 2021 

• Site plan with existing conditions and tree save shown 

• Site plan with partial landscape planting plan shown 

• Revised elevations 

• Streetscape with elevations 

• 3-D views 

STAFF ANALYSIS :

Staff has the following comments about the proposal: 

1. Context: The context is the immediate surroundings of a project 

a. Guidelines, page 2.5: “In evaluating a project proposal, the HDC and its staff refer to the adopted design guidelines that are based on the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. They also examine the specific context of the property in question .” 

b. New Construction Guidelines, page 6.1 “Charlotte’s historic districts’ distinctive character is derived not only from architectural style but also from the nature of the street created by building setback, spacing, mass, and height as well as the landscape quality. This street character and the surrounding properties are considered to be the context for any new building. As such, the block in which the new site is located should be carefully studied when designing a new infill dwelling. This context should include both sides of the subject street .” 

2. Massing + Spacing: The project consists of three buildings with 5 units and one building with 7 units, which makes for a long mass, not historically seen in historic multifamily in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood. Breaking the townhomes up into smaller buildings of two or three townhomes would help to break down the massing of the project and provide spacing more in-keeping with the residential structures throughout Plaza Midwood. This also applies to width of new buildings, page 6.6. At three stories the townhomes mass and scale is larger any other historic structure in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood. The topography of the lot does lessen this impact along the Plaza, but not along Belvedere Avenue. See Height + Width, Guidelines page 6.6. 

3. HVAC location/screening. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST] :

No one accepted Ms. Parati’s invitation to speak for or against this application. 

MOTION : CONTINUED 1st : MURYN 2nd : RUMSCH 

Mr. Muryn moved to continue this application, for guideline 6.1 and 2.5 for context as the building that fronts The Plaza relates to its context. Note on the plan the HVAC locations that was discussed to be in the roof or hidden by the roof parapets. Look into further development of the building along Thurmond as it pertains to the stepping of the façade and other embellishments around the front door of the individual units. 

Ms. Hindman added a friendly amendment, separate the dormers so they are true dormers and provide a continuous cornice line at the second story and to eliminate any material transition at the exterior corners of the dormers. 6

Mr. Barth added a friendly amendment, to include some additional details on the architectural elements and trimming. 

Ms. Hindman added a friendly amendment, we have not evaluated the project for guidelines 6.11 through 6.16 or Chapter 8.

APPLICATION :

HDCCMA 2019-00827, 1316 THOMAS AVENUE (PID: 08117305) – NEW CONSTRUCTION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS :

The proposed project site is currently a vacant lot being used for parking. It is located at the edge of the Plaza Midwood local historic district. Lot size is approximately 50’ x 150. 9

PROPOSAL :

The project was Approved with Conditions at the October 14, 2020 HDC Meeting. 

After the HDC approval, the architect proceeded with the construction documents and determined that the overall height was not quite enough after exploring all possible alternate solutions with their consultants. An additional 5.25” of height is needed based on the final evaluation of all the integrated components. This includes the interior floor trusses and the mechanical ductwork. 

Many alternatives were studied and considered including cutting the studs down, changing the roof pitch, lowering all the doors and windows, but these alternatives impacted the exterior appearance, which would have resulted with new submission. 

The Structural Engineer and the Mechanical Engineer determined the minimal floor system needed, thus altering the height by only 5.25” at the main hip ridge. The revised front elevation that demonstrates the needed additional 5.25” does not impact appearance of the previously approved project. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION :

1. The project is not incongruous with the district and meets guidelines for Additions, page 7.2 and New Construction, Chapter 6. 

2. Per 10.4.1 of the Rules for Procedure, staff recommends Approval of the projects for meeting all Guidelines and that this item be heard as a Consent Agenda item, with permit-ready construction drawings submitted to staff for final review. 

3. If requested by a Commission member, or if an interested party has signed up to speak in opposition, then the HDC shall open the application for a full hearing.
