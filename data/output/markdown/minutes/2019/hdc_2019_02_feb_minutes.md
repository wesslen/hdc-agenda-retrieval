visible from the street. 

This is highly visible because the ridge would go up seven feet, six inches.

existing building. T he proposed visually overpowers the building and changes the 

directional expression from horizontal to vertical .

secondary to those of the existing structure. 

This does not maintain the existing roof pitch and raises the main ridge. 

• 7.2, #6 – Make sure that the design of a new addition is compatible with the existing 

building. 12 

This is not compatible with the original massing, scale, directional expression, or roof form .

Specifically, the proposed sloped element is not in keeping with the original pi tch of the roof.

National Register listing. Basic one -story frame house with side -gabled roof broken by two gabled dormers and a

cent ered portico . Portico shield s center bay and has front -facing gable. 6/6 sash windows.

DECISION: PAINTED MASONRY OF CHIMNEY APPROVED 

APPLICATION : HDC 2019 -022, 2114 DILWORTH ROAD E – PAINTED MASONRY 

EXISTING CONDITIONS 

The existing structure is a 1.5 story Craftsman bungalow house constructed c. 1925. Architectural features include 

a partial -width front porch supported by triple square columns atop wood piers, batten siding in the front gable, 

and 6/1 wood windows. The lot size is approximately 66’ x 162’. The HDC approved the painting of the house “to 

unify disparate parts of the building ext erior” on January 14, 2015. Existing front entry doors appear to be 

original or perhaps early replacements due to hardware and glass. 

PROPOSAL 

The proposal includes the request to paint a new brick fireplace/chimney on the rear of the structure. All other 

portions of the addition are approvable at the staff level 

The proposal is to change the front entry doors. The applicant is requesting to enlarge the height of both sets of 

front doors, install a transom above each and replace both front doors wit h new doors in a similar design. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION 

Staff has the following concerns with the proposal: 

1. Guidelines for Masonry, 5.5 item 3, and Paint 5.8, item 7, require unpainted brick to remain unpainted; 

however, the reference is to historic ma sonry. The guidelines are silent on whether or not new brick can be 

painted, only referencing brick as a traditional material appropriate for new construction in Materials, 6.15, 

item 1. 

Therefore, the Commission will decide if the new addition of an ou tdoor fireplace/chimney element may be 

painted to coordinate with the painted brick house as previously approved by the Commission in 2015 under 

the old guidelines. 

2. The rear entry door/transom is not original to the house. A previously open rear porch was infilled at a later 

date. 

3. The front doors appear to be original, including the heights. 

4. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 

FOR/AGAINST: No one accepted Ms. Hindman’s invitation to speak either FOR or AGAINST the application. 

MOTION: Based on compliance with the Charlotte Historic District Design Guidelines, Painted Masonry –

large front gable pediment with Palladian -inspired three -part window, a wraparound porch (partially enclosed) 

with Doric columns, a decora tive front entrance with a transom and sidelights, corner trim detailed as square

windows. All roof and trim details will be wood to match existi ng. The proposal includes the removal of one 

canopy tree. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION 

Staff has the following concerns with the proposal: 

1. As a structure with many classical elements, staff would recommend a bracket design more in keeping with 

the archit ecture of the house, rather than using the more Craftsman -style bracket as shown. 

2. The project is not incongruous with the district and meets guidelines for Additions, page 7.2. 

3. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 18
