APPLICATION: HDC 2018 -663, 224 -236 WEST KINGSTON AVENUE – NEW CONSTRUCTION 

The application was denied June 13 for the following items: Item 6.2, setback. Being 16 fee t closer to the street 

than the adjacent historic properties on this block on this side of the street does not make it within 10 percent of 

the historic setback of the adjacent structures. Item 6.4, orientation. The orientati on of the front entrances does 

not face the street. Item 6.6, height. At the proposed 38 to 43 feet in height from grade, this does not meet the 

historic height of 241 West Kingston Avenue across the street which is the historic multifamily building that t his 

per our guidelines may be compared to. That building is 32 feet from grade; therefore, this project must not 

exceed 32 feet in height at any portion. Item 6.7, scale. The rear of the buildings does not relate to the 

surrounding structures. Item 6.9, fo undations. The foundation height of the proposal is 2 feet, and it does not 

reflect the historic foundation height of the two historic homes which are adjacent to the property. 

EXISTING CON DITIONS 

The four properties are one story structures that were re -used for a day care; existing zoning is R -22 Multi -Family. 

The buildings are connected with heated space. 236 West Kingston Ave. was constructed in 1923 and connected 

to 232, 228 and 224 were also c onnected to make one building. They were constructed in 1936 and 1940 

respectively. A 365 -Day Stay of Demolition was approved by the HDC September 13, 2017. Adjacent structures 

are commercial and single family (one story) on the block. Across the street ar e single and multi -family buildings. 

The historic multi -family building at 241 West Kingston Avenue was constructed in 1949, the height is 

approximately 32’ measured from grade. Its adjacent single -family house (245 West Kingston Avenue) was 

constructed i n 1954, approximate height is 33’. The single -family house at 251 West Kingston Avenue was 

constructed in 1936 with a pre -Historic District rear addition height of approximately 40’.

more urban residential district. Front setback of the project is approximately 53’ from back of curb to the 6’ deep 

front stoop. Front setback to the heated living space is approximately 59’ from back of cu rb. Site features include 

an 8’ side yard and brick pillar/wood fence along the single -family side, and either a 15 -foot landscaped buffer or 

11.25’ buffer with wood fence behind the alley easement in the rear yard. Existing and proposed trees are noted

Building A. 

2. Contextual criteria of massing, roof form, cornices and trim, window materials, stoops/porches (particularly

APPLICATION : HDC 201 9-008 , 1101 MYRTLE AVENUE – NEW CONSTRUCTION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS 

The existing structure is a two -story multi -family apartment building constructed in 1980. Adjacent structures are 

a mix of single -family, multi -family, and commercial uses. The residential structures are a mix of one -story, one -

and -one half story, and two -story heights. On December 16, 2018, the HDC voted to approve the demolition 

which make take place upon the approval of new construction plans and to waive the 90 -day waiting period for 

the review of new construction plans .

PROPOSAL 

The proposal is a new four -unit townhome project. Front setback of the project is approximately 20’ – 1 ¼” from 

back of the existing city sidewalk on Myrtle Avenue and 13’ -9” from the back of the city sidewalk on Lexington 

Avenue. Proposed trees are noted on the site plan. 

Building h eight ranges from 42’ -9 ½” to 43’ -9 ½” from grade. Materials include Hardie Artisan siding and trim, 

brick walls, aluminum clad Simulated True Divided Light (STDL) windows, wood doors, metal porch rails, wood 

shutters, painted aluminum garage doors with a pplied 1x battens. Fenestration patterns and material palette vary 

per individual townhouse unit on the front elevations. 

STAFF CONCERNS 

1. The scale/height relationship between the proposed project and the historic single -family houses at 808 

Lexington Av enue and 728 Lexington. 

FOR/AGAINST: Mr. Robert Lesnick, adjacent property , owner spoke in opposition of this application. 

Mr. Stan Smith, adjacent property owner , spoke in opposition of this application. 

Ms. Danielle Burger, adjacent property owner , spoke in opposition of this application. 

MOTION: Based on non -compliance with Charlotte Historic District Design Guidelines Ms. Titus made a

MOTION to DENY this application for its failure to meet our guidelines for the following: 

• 6. 6. item 2, Height – The height of a proposed building should be no taller than the 

tallest historic building on the block within a 360 -degree range . The proposed 

elevation on Lexington Avenue is 42 feet, nine inches between these two historic 

single -family homes. This e xceeds what is appropriate for the historic structures 

surrounding. • Setback – the proposed building does not respect the historic setback on the 800 block 

of Lexington Avenue and actually pulls the new construction forward or proud of the 

single -family hom es on this block and the 700 block. The existing building matches the 

setback of the adjacent neighbor. See page 2 of the applicant’s handout which shows 

the violation of the historic established setback along Lexington Avenue. 

• Scale – the proposed does not respect the scale of the single -family houses on 

Lexington or the multifamily Myrtle Square historic complex. 

• Width – at 128 feet, the proposed construction does not meet our guideline, because 

the applicant has failed to show any evidence of ho w this complies with 6.6 item 3: 

design new buildings to respect the width of original structures in the district, of being 

within ten percent of the average spacing of historic homes on Myrtle Avenue. 

• Ms. Hindman friendly amendment the numbers are a little bit different than yours. For 

728 22.2 feet, for 808, 19.1 feet based on the spot elevation on that side of the house, 

Myrtle Square 24.3 feet that’s based on the spot elevation at the building foundation 

because it varies. That is the grade at the building. 

• Ms. Titus and Ms. Walker accepted Ms. Hindman’s friendly amendment .

• Ms. Titus this motion does not indicate that we’ve considered any of our other criteria, 

that we are denying the application based on these four items. We reserve all other 

criteria to b e evaluated in the future.

JO HN PAHARES LEFT THE MEETING A T 6:37PM. HE DID NOT RETURN. 

APPLICATION: HDC 20 19 -001 , 1817 WILMORE DRIVE - NON -TRADITIONAL MATERIAL 

EX ISTING CONDITIONS 

The existing structure is a one -story Craftsman bungalow constructed in 1933. The original siding material is wood 

lap with wood trim. During the fall 2018 storms , a neighbor’s tree fell on the left corner of the house causing 

damage to the roof. Staff issued an Emergency Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) for repairs to match existing, which allowed for the replacement of any damaged vinyl siding on the front le ft corner of the house. The project 

contractors removed all the vinyl siding on the house, exposing the original wood siding. Total replacement of the 

vinyl siding on all four sides of the house exceeds the repairs staff is authorized to a pprove under an Emergency 

COA. 

PROPOSAL 

The applicant is requesting approval to install new vinyl siding over the entire house. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION 

1. The commission will determine if the re -installation of non -traditional material meets the guidelines. 

FOR/AGAINST: No one accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak either FOR or AGAINST the application .

MOTION: Based on compliance with Charlotte Historic District Design Guideline s Ms. Titus made a 

MOTION to APPROVE this application as dra wn for the following reasons: the repair is 

necessary due to the storm damage, and there were emergency repairs required to the existing 

vinyl. The contractor exceeded his purview and removed all the vinyl siding without 

homeowner approval. The condition of the original wood siding is severely deteriorated, and 

the home should be restored to is pre -storm condition. The vinyl was installed circa 1980, prior 

to the establishment of the Wilmore Historic District and this is an act of god that precipitated 

an emergency COA at the state level. This as presented is the best solution for returning the 

house to its pre -storm condition.
