are utilitarian concrete block buildings constructed as service garages. Lot size is 150 x 150. Adjacent structures are 

commercial building s, parking lots and single family residential to the rear along Westwood Avenue and Wickford Place. 

1529 South Mint appears to originally have been a small flat roof building, and a later addition with shallow pitch gable 

roof added to the back. Windo w and door opening sizes also vary between the front portion and back addition. The 

most notable features on 1529 South Mint street are the original windows on the left and right elevations. 12 

1537 South Mint Street is four -bay concrete block building. T he fourth bay on the right elevation appears to be a later 

addition to the structure. The building has a minimalist parapet roof delineated by Roman brick found on many mid -

century buildings, which is difficult to see because the brick is painted. This bri ck feature wraps around the left elevation 

for a few courses under the flat roof. There appears to be two original windows on the far rear right elevation.
