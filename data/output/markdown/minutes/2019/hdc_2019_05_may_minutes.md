Ms. Titus made a motion to approve this application with the following c onditions to be approved by staff : the 

nonoriginal vinyl window on the left elevation is to be replaced with staff to approve the replacement or to stay as 

existing. Note that while we recognize the proposed driveway change, it does not follow guideline 8 .2, number 6, we 

feel that maintaining the original rear wall of the house is more important in this proposal.
