EXISTING CON DITIONS: 

The existing structure was constructed in 1905 and identified as a contributing structure in the Dilworth National

STAFF RECOMMENDA TION: 

Staff has the following concerns with the proposal: 

# 1. The proposed bracket design is incongruous with the Victorian elements on the building. A bracket/corbel that 

is a simple nod to Victorian -style would fit better than the proposed Craftsman -style bracket, as outlined in 

Porches, page 6.14 #3. 

# 2. The proposal for the shed roof addition is not incongruous with the District and meets the guidelines for 

Additions 7.2. 

# 3. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff.

attempts to remove a portion of the drive will damage the foundation of the house.

addition to the structure. The building has a minimalist parapet roof delineated by Roman brick found on many mid -

century buildings, which is difficult to see because the brick is painted. This brick feature wraps aroun d the left elevation 

for a few courses under the flat roof. There appear to be two original windows on the far rear right elevation.
