reconstruction of the front left corner of the house which is failing, all new materials (siding, windows, trim, etc.) will 

match existing. Post -construction the rear yard will be 41% impervious. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 

Staff has the following concerns with the proposal:

MOTION: DENIED/CONTINUED 1st : Mr. Henningson 2nd : Ms. Titus 

Mr. Henningson, made a motion to deny the following two components: per guideline 4 .4, number 6, do not paint the 

brick. Per guideline 8.2, number 8, do not pave up to the foundation and allow for a planting strip of six to twelve inches 

in width. I want to continue the following: Per guideline 4.4, number 8, repair windows to match the s ame dimensions 

as the original. Guideline 4.4, number 1, retain original windows on the left elevation to the left of the chimney, and new 

windows shoul d match the style and dimension of the original. Per guideline 6.12, number 1, revisit the fenestration on 

the right side of the addition. Rear columns to match the style and the dimension of the columns on the front. And I 

want to add a tree protection plan. 4

Friendly amendment: Ms. Titus, I think staff might want clarification in the motion that we are saying the original 

windows to the left of the chimney that must remain are only the first double ganged windows to the immediate left of 

the chimney. Mr. Henningson accepted the friendly amendment. 

Friendly amendment : Ms. Hartenstein friendly amendment o n the columns, just to point it to the guidelines. I would 

point them to 3.16 just in general for bungalows and then 4.11 for trim.

windows are 6/1 pattern.

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The house is a one -story American Small House with Tudor Revival features constructed in 1938. According to Sanborn 

Maps the structure was originally built as a du plex. Exterior features include a symmetrical brick façade, chimneys and 

half timbering details on both side gable ends, and nearly full width front porch. The stuccoed entry way appears to be a 

later addition, as evidenced by the following: a.) the stuc co material and half -timbering does not match the gable ends 

(half -timbering on the front gable is flush with the stucco), b.) trim detailing particularly at the bottom corners of the 

gable, c.) the enclosure is not centered on the front elevation and is l ocated closer to the paired windows on the right; 

all of which is incongruous with symmetry and details found throughout the rest of the structure. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project includes a new covered front porch built over the existing brick/concrete porch floor, and changes 

to window and door openings on the right and left elevations. Materials are all traditional to match existing. The new 

window openings and existing windows to be repaired are noted on the floor plan (A1.1). Proposed new double -hung 

windows will be aluminum clad in a 6/1 pattern to match existing. The small rear addition shown on the plans is not for 

HDC review; due to size and location the project was reviewed Administratively under COA# HDCADMRM -2018 -00662. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATI ON: 

1. The proposal for the front porch is not incongruous with the District and meets the guidelines for Additions, 7.2 and 

New Construction above. 

2. Commission will determine if changes to window and door openings on the right and left elevations meet the 

guidelines. 

3. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff .

N/A 

APPLICATION: HDC 2019 -157 , 1751 MERRIMAN AVENUE – NON -TRADITIONAL MATERIALS 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The house is a one -story American Small House with Tudor Revival element constructed in 1949. Exterior features 

include a prominent brick chimney, fixed diamond pane window, small engaged front porch, wood windows in a 1/1 

pattern, and German -lap wood sidi ng. 7

PROPOSAL: 

The proposed project request is to remove the original German -lap wood siding from the main house and install new 

Nichiha Savannah Smooth fiber cement siding on both the main house and the rear addition. All window trim, corner 

boards, roo f trim, etc. is also proposed to be changed from wood to fiber -cement on both the original house and the 

addition. Requesting painted brick foundation on the rear addition to match existing painted foundation on the original 

house. A new driveway measuri ng approximately 18’ wide + 2’ of decorative pavers and 51.3 ’ long is also proposed. 

Due to size and location, the rear addition itself is eligible for Administrative approval; however, the siding/trim material 

changes to the main house, proposed driveway, and painted brick foundation on the addition all require HDC approval. 

STAFF RECOM MENDATION: 

1. The Commission will determine the appropriate course of action for non -traditional material use, the proposed 

driveway, and the painting of the rear addition foundation. 

2. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: DENIED/CONTINUED 1st : Mr. Rumsch 2nd : Mr. Phares 

Mr. Rumsch made a motion to deny the removal of the German lap siding. I move to approve painting of the 

foundation. I move to continue for more detail of the driveway and the transition from the existing siding to the siding 

of the addition if she’s going to be using a different material. With a note to maintain foundation height all the way 

around the house. 

Ms. Titus , the denial is building materials wood 5.2, number 1, 2, 3, and 7. 

Ms. Hindman , the front yard parking and carriage tracks are 8.2 .

Ms. Walker , the paint is building materials, 5.8. 

Ms. Hindman , can you specify new foundation in the paint. I would just request of staff with this transition to a different 

material, it’s going to come back with some issues that would lend to a domino effect of details that go with that, like 

sill, corne r board. For the nontraditional, it needs to match the corner boards and the other trim. It's going to be shy 

with the nontraditional material, and that's not the intent.
