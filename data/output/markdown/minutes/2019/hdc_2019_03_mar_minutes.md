ABSENT: HARTENSTINE, HINDMAN, JORDAN, MARSHALL 

MR. HENNINGSON HAD A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND RECUSED HIMSELF FROM THE MEETING. 

APPLICATION: HDC 2019 -048, 224, 228, 232 and 236 W KINGSTON AVENE – NEW CONSTRUCTION 

The application was denied January 16, 2019 for the following: Setback, height and width, scale, foundation, porches 

and incongruous with the character of the district in its neighborhood context and i ts gateway location. Per Guideline 

6.6, number 3, the evidence to demonstrate the width should be based on the original structures. The HDC has not 

evaluated the other guidelines. 

EXISTING CON DITIONS: 

The four properties are one story structures that wer e re -used for a day care; existing zoning is R -22 Multi -Family. The 

buildings are connected with heated space. 236 West Kingston Ave. was constructed in 1923 and connected to 232, 228 

and 224 were also connected to make one building. They were constructed in 1936 and 1940 respectively. A 365 -Day 

Stay of Demolition was approved by the HDC September 13, 2017. Adjacent structures are commercial and single family 

(one story) on the block. Across the street are single and multi -family buildings. The historic mu lti -family building at 241 

West Kingston Avenue was constructed in 1949, the height is approximately 32’ measured from grade. Its adjacent 

single -family house (245 West Kingston Avenue) was constructed in 1954, approximate height is 33’. The single -family 

house at 251 West Kingston Avenue was constructed in 1936 with a pre -Historic District rear addition height of 

approximately 40’. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is new construction of townhouses. The project is in the rezoning process to a more urban residen tial 

district, UR -2. Front setback of the project is approximately 53’ from back of curb to the 6’ deep front stoop. Front 

setback to the heated living space is approximately 59’ from back of curb. Site features include a 5’ side yard and brick 

pillar/wo od fence along the single -family side, and either a 15 -foot landscaped buffer or 11.25’ buffer with wood fence 

behind the alley easement in the rear yard. Existing and proposed trees are noted on the site plan. STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 

Staff has the follo wing concerns with the proposal: 

1. The scale/height relationship between the historic single -family houses at 244 and 240 W. Kingston and Building A. 

2. Contextual criteria of massing (particularly on Buildings A, and C), stoops/porches (particularly on Buildin gs D + E), 

roof form, and rhythm. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

Dennis Mayo, neighborhood resident , spoke in opposition of this application. 

MOTION: 1st : Ms. Tama ra Titus 2nd : Mr. Damon Rumsch 

MS. TITUS: I move to deny this application, because the project does not meet the following guidelines: Height and 

width, number 6.6, 1, 2, and 3. At 36 feet tall, all of the buildings are taller from grade than the historic multifamily 

across the street at 241 West Kingston, and they do not respect the single -family homes at 244 and 240 West Kingston 

per the applicant's slide number 24. Scale, number 6.7. For width, buildings D and E are 64 feet and 94 feet wide, and 

the applicant has failed to show a h istoric building anywhere close to this width within the c ontext area. Then scale, 

number 6.7. And massing, 6.5 of the guidelines. Specifically, the project fails to meet our guidelines for massing for 

buildings A, C, D, and E, with the dormers of A and C failing to meet and the entire building of D and E failing to meet. 

We are denyi ng the application specifically for failure to meet these guidelines with the note that the additional 

guidelines that are applicable have not been considered and remain open for consideration. MS. TITUS: I'm going to 

take the (J. Pah ares) friendly amendment to add roof forms which is number 6.10. And I'm going to say we have not 

made a determination on setback, because I think there's more to be discussed on that, and there are also six of 11 

sitting commissioners right now. So, I wan t to leave some leeway to hear what those folks think. 

VOTE: 6/0 AYES: HADEN, , PARATI, RUMSCH, TITUS, WALKER , PHARES 

NAYS: NONE 

DECISION: 

APPLICATION FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION OF TOWN HOMES DENIED

MR. HENNINGSON RETURNS TO MEETING 

MS. HARTENSTINE ARRIVES AT 1:54PM 

APPLICATION: HDC 2019 -113 1700 HEATHCLIFF AVENUE -TREE REMOVAL 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The sit e is a triangular vacant lot at the end of a street and at the edge of the Wesley Heights Local Historic District. The 

site is approximately 10 feet above West 4 th Street. There are mature trees on the site. There is not an established front 

setback on t he street. The site has an unimproved alley on one side. The adjacent properties within the District are two 

story quadraplex buildings that are on a lower elevation. The adjacent single -family house is not in the District. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is t o obtain retroactive approval for tree removal. The Commission approved plans for new construction 

at its May 10, 2017 hearing and specifically stated in the motion that “no trees will be removed for construction.” The 

removed tree was not noted on the presented/approved site plan. The applicant has submitted a new site plan with all 

mature trees noted, including the removed tree and two large mature canopy trees located at the front of the lot. 

Note: The two mature canopy trees at the front of t he lot are located within a few feet of the proposed front porch; a site 

condition that was not addressed during the May 10, 2017 hearing for the New Construction approval, so no tree 

protection plan was provided for these trees. (This is a similar condit ion to the 1912 S. Mint Street, New Construction, 

Case Number; 2016 -166). STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 

Staff has the following concerns: 

1. A tree protection plan for the two mature canopy trees at the front of the lot should be provided to staff for 

review/app roval within 30 days. 

2. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff (such as review/approval of replacement trees). 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

Rachel (Last Name?) neighborhood resident spoke in opposition of this application. 

MOTION: 1st : Ms. Parati 2nd : Mr. Rumsch 

Ms. Parati moved to approve this application with the following conditions, according to Guidelines 8.5, #4 through #6, 

we request a tree protection plan as defined by a certified arborist to be presented and approved by staff within 3 0

days. We also request a large shade tree as defined by the City of Charlotte within the 2 ½ to 3 inch caliper to replace 

the one that was lost. We also request a accurate site plan showing the two existing trees and the plans for the position 

of the ne w tree that is being planted.

MR. PAHARES LEFT THE MEETING AT 4:52PM 

APPLICATION: HDC 2019 -095 _612 E. TREMONT AVENUE - PORCH ADDITION 

EXISTING CONDITIONS: 

The existing property is a 1.5 story Craftsman bungalow constructed in 1915, according to the National Register 

nomination. Architectural features include a cross gable roof, brackets, and Dutch -lap siding. The original front porch 

was converted to heated space prior to Dilworth’s designation as a local district. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is the addition of a 6 -foot deep front porch. Established setbacks on the street prevent the construction of 

the porch per Zoning; however, the applicant is requesting approval from the Zoning Administration staff to use the 

alternative setback provision in the zoning ordinance (included below). Proposed materials include bric k foundation, 

brick piers and tapered wood columns, wood siding in the gable, and wood trim. No trees will be impacted by this 

project. 

STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 

3. The Commission will determine if the proposed front porch meets the Design Guidelines. 

4. Mino r revisions may be reviewed by staff. 

SPEAKERS [FOR | AGAINST]: 

No one accepted Mr. Haden’s invitation to speak either for or against this application. 

MOTION: 1st : Mr. Henningson 2nd : Mr. Rumsch 

Mr. Henningson made a motion to deny this applic ation for not meeting our Guidelines 6.2 number 1, setback should be 

within plus or minus ten percent of the original historic setback on the block. Guidelines 6.14, number 4, porches should 

be a minimum depth of eight feet. 

Ms. Titus added an amendment : if this commission were to violate its guidelines and allow a porch that is less than 

eight feet and that also violates the historic setback on the block, we would be faced with other applications from 

Dilworth properties that have existing enclosed porc hes that date back prior to the establishment of the historic district, 

and this case would set a precedent requiring us to allow those homeowners or business owners to capture new space 

without reopening the historic porch. If we were to make an exceptio n for houses where the front porch was enclosed 

prior to the district becoming historic, we would set a precedent for future houses that were trying to recapture or 

trying to add open space on top of heated space they had already captured that was historic ally inappropriate. Original 

front porch is eight feet deep. Mr. Henningson accepted Ms. Titus ’s friendly amendment.
