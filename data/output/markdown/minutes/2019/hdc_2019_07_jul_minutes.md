EXISTING CONDITIONS:

basic rectangular mass covered with a hipped roof. Architectural features include exposed rafters on the front dormers, 

8/1 wood double -hung windows, an engaged front porch supported by pain ted brick piers and square wood columns, 

wood vent details, two brick chimneys, and German siding. The lot slopes down from right to left. Existing ridge height is 

17’ -2” on the right and 17’ -9” on the left. The lot size is approximately 55’ x 187.5’. 

PROPOSAL: 

The proposal is an addition located approximately 45’ back from the fr ont thermal wall of the house. The pro posed ridge 

height is 20’ -0”. The addition also bumps out on both the right and left elevations. On the left elevation a pair of non -

histo ric replacement windows will be removed and salvaged historic windows from elsewhere on the house will be 

installed. Proposed materials are brick foundation, wood German lap siding and trim to match existing, and new 

windows will be either double -hung or c asement with Simulated True Divided Lights (STDL) in a 6/1 pattern to match

STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 

Staff has the following concerns wit h the proposal: 

1. The loss of original rear corners of the house and massing. 

2. Height does not appear to be an issue because the new roof line is 45’ behind the front thermal wall of the house. 13 

3. Brackets, while a Craftsman feature, were not part of the house’s original design. Recommend the removal of all 

brackets with the possible exception of the left elevation bump out where the brackets provide a modern 

architectural interpretation and help to delineate the start of the new rear addition. 

4. Al l windows, doors, rear porch columns, and other details are not incongruous with the structure or the district. 

5. Minor revisions may be reviewed by staff.

demolition; however, all design review for proposed changes remains under the Historic District Commission’s sole 

oversight.

The proposal is to relocate th e front doors. As -built, the front doors are side entry. The project would move the front 

doors to b e a front street -facing entry. The front doors themselves are non -original to the building. One was a slab door 

and the other a bui lder grade 6 -panel met al door. The proposed doors are wood doors with a six -light window at the 

top. Muntins will be wood and exterior Simulated True Divided Light (STDL). No other changes or additions are
