HDC Meeting 

## Applicant Submitted Information Information Submitted by the Public 429 E Tremont homeowners - additional information on Pecan Tree: 

Craig Errington with Heartwood Tree Service visited the site to inspect the referenced pecan tree on 

12 /14 /2023 and has agreed to provide the HDC required documentation .

In 2018 , a mature willow oak from a neighboring lot fell and damaged the pecan tree in our backyard, 

stripping all of the branches on the western -facing side (refer to photos 1 and 2). While the tree has produced 

some foliage since that time, we remain concerned that the tree was compromised and will be more 

susceptible to falling in a severe storm because of the significant imbalance in the crown . The pecan tree also 

regularly drops nuts and limbs that have damaged our vehicles (examples in photos 3, 4, and 5) and pose a

risk to our two children (ages 2 and 6) that frequently play and ride their scooters and bikes in the backyard .

We are committed to replacing the pecan in our backyard with another approved non -nut producing large 

maturing tree per the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual (CLDSM) and in collaboration with the 

HDC staff’s pre -approved canopy tree list . Dilworth’s trees are one of the defining characteristics of the 

neighborhood, and we have supported maintenance of the canopy over the years by regularly contributing to 

the Dilworth Community Association Share the Shade campaign and replacing diseased trees on our property .

In the spring of 2019 and again in the spring of 2021 , we replaced dead trees on our property (killed by 

ambrosia beetles in both instances) according to the HDC standards .

Dear HDC Staff: This email, with attachments, is from Thomas E. Williams. I 

reside at 1933 Dilworth Road West. I received a letter dated March 1, 2024 that 

Ms. Kristi Harpst sent to property owners adjacent to 1910 Ewing Ave, which is 

item 15 on March 13, 2024 agenda, as case # HDCRMA -2023 -00949. 

Attached are 3 items that I will refer to with regards to item 15 on March 13, 2024 

agenda, HDCRMA -2023 -00949. That agenda item pertains to an “ACCESSORY 

STRUCTURE”, among other things, contemplated for 1910 Ewing Ave. 

I am aware that the 3 attached items all pertain to work previously done at 1914 

Ewing Ave. However, 1914 Ewing Ave. is next door to 1910 Ewing Ave., and like 

1910 Ewing Ave., it is adjacent to my property. Aspects of the work previously 

done at 1914 Ewing Ave. are relevant to the project under consideration at 1910 

Ewing Ave. I labelled the 3 attached items “1910 Ewing Ave HDCRMA -2023 -

00949”, simply because the aforementioned letter dated M arch 1, 2024 states that 

“…documents must be labeled with the project address and case number”, and the 

project that I will address is 1910 Ewing Ave, HDCRMA -2023 -00949. 

I will be speaking against 1910 Ewing Ave, item 15 on March 13, 2024 agenda, 

HDCRMA -2023 -00949, for reasons that include, but are not necessarily limited to, 

the effect that the proposed project will have on rainwater runoff that can be 

expected to flow onto my property, absent design and construction measures that 

will reliably serve to c ontain all such runoff onto 1910 Ewing Ave, and deliver all 

such runoff to the stormwater system on Ewing Ave. I am unaware of any 

measures (i.e. a sump basin, appropriately sized pump, battery backup, etc.) that 

are part of the proposed project to keep th e runoff onto 1910 Ewing Ave., and 

direct it to the stormwater system on Ewing Ave. It is important to note that it will not be enough for any approved plans for 1910 

Ewing Ave. to include such measures, but that the measures are in fact put in 

place. The attached photos of work done next door at 1914 Ewing Ave, 

demonstrate how the HDC can approve plans that are later disregarded during the 

construction process. (Compare the “New concrete carriage tracts w/river stone 

between” that was approved for 1914 Ew ing Ave., to the driveway that was built 

instead.) 

Mr. Faucette: Please construe this email as my pre -registration for the March 

13, 2024 meeting. As required by the aforementioned letter dated March 1, 2024, I 

am advising that my name is Thomas E. Williams. My email address is 

tom@carolinatortmediator.com . My phone number is 704 -905 -7240. For the 

reasons noted above, I will be speaking against the proposed project at 1910 Ewing 

Ave, being item 15 on the March 13, 2024 agenda, case # HDCRMA -2023 -00949. 

Sincerely, 

Thomas E. Williams Existing Conditions
