In regards to: 501 N Poplar St (PID 07803623) HDCRMA-2024-00171 Fourth Ward Ryan Baird, Applicant 

I am unable to attend the meeting on April 10 and could not find any information about how to submit comments on the HDC website, so I am providing this way. I would appreciate confirmation of receipt. 

I own the home that is adjacent to (and basically surrounds) this planned new residential building: 310 W 8th and 505 N Poplar Streets (see attached image, green outline). 

Based on the current submission, the plan does not adhere to the required setbacks - not in a historical context nor by published code requirements in Section 6.5 of the HDC Design Standards. Moreover, this new dwelling does not adhere to the Height and Width guidelines (6.9), nor the guidance for corner lots, nor the fence guidelines (8.7). 

Neither lot technically has a backyard. But the new design is supposed to honor the historical context of the existing buildings. This plan considerably exceeds those, in particular on the North and West sides of the lot (one of which must be considered my backyard, requiring even more setback). Although the Guidelines state that a solid privacy fence is not allowed, there has been one on the North and West sides of this lot for many decades and I frankly insist that it be allowed since that lot and the planned building encroach on my privacy. 

I am troubled that this plan is being considered without regard to the neighborhood dwellings within a 360 view. This new dwelling will completely obliterate the view of the historic trees in Fourth Ward Park that Hackberry Court has had since it was built. And will interfere with the view that the existing houses have had of the city. In particular, the turrets disturb those views. 

Further, the new dwelling's windows will look DIRECTLY into mine. I am not certain why this has not been considered an issue by the HDC.
