HDC Meeting 

Applicant Submitted Information Hamilton Residence 

416 Hermitage Co urt 

Charlotte, N orth Carolina 

Staff Analysis / Comme nt 

Please note that there is currently a second floor existing at 416 Hermitage Court. Our intent is to 

rework the existing space under this existing roof with new additional square footage at the rear. 

1. Fro nt Elevation 

a. Loss of mullion trim – We have the option to reduce the width of the new French 

casement s and still meet egress requirements if the larger mullion trim is desired by the 

Board. We would like to keep the new window s as French casements to meet current 

egre ss requirements and the windows with the mutins in lieu of the original casement 

design. 

b. Design of the replacement windows – The existing double hung windows and fixed 

windows are from an earlier renovation . It is the intent of the new windows to evoke the 

original casements and the original craftsman style. 

c. Roof trim – It is the intent to emphasis the Cr aftsman style eave detail .

2. Rear Elevation 

a. As ymmetrical rear gable – The intent is to work within and under the existing main roof 

ridge parallel to Hermitage Court. The n ew additional square footage roof should not be 

seen fr om the street and the new rear dormer should feel like it was always there . We

worked with two factors in mind: align the new roof eave with the existing eave and the 

new roof should not ex tend above the main existing roof. The new roof will be non -vented 

and there will be no ridge vent .

3. Left Elevation 

a. Fenestration – It is the inte nt to simplify a previous renovation and strea mline the roof 

de sign. 

4. Provide Specifications and Sample of Lo ewen Window – A sample of the double hung 

window was given to HDC. The windows shall be wood to match the existing . T he exterior 

casing shall match the existing and shall include the sill. 

5. Beam/ Column – The intent is to keep the existing front por ch and porte cochere beam. Notes 

in the drawings that refer to a “new beam ” shall be removed from the drawings. Please note, 

if the beam cladding need s to be repaired or replaced, it shall be install ed to ma tch the 

existing wood and reveals. See 1/ A2.0 , 2/ A2 .0 and 5/ A3.1. 

6. Mature Canopy – There are currently no mature canopy trees on the site. The neighbor, 420 

Hermitage Court, has a large pecan tree that extends over the property line on the left side. 

7. Site Changes – There are no site changes proposed .

Please see supplem ental drawings for further clarifications. Window sample 1707/1709 Lennox Avenue

Wood Proposal Examples similar to what exists today all 

mechanicals for auto -gate will be located on interior side of 

gate and fence Front Entry 

Front entry to have brick stairs 

leading to front door. Matching 

current brick stairs already 

present on the home. If needed 

based on code, a wrought iron 

handrail will be installed as 

shown, to match existing railing 

on the home and to match the 

railing on the garage. Gas or 

electric lantern to be hanging in 

covered area. 

This overhang has been deleted. 

The casing at front façade where 

the recessed entry starts, propose 

either a precast or wood trim 

surround to break up the brick and 

emphasize the entry. Approximately 

8-10” wide all around. Front Entry 

## OR 

Match the 

existing Windsor 

doors with TDL,

door but still has TDL 

in a 1 5/8” muntin size • Windsor Windows Product:

Preference is to stick with Windsor Pinnacle Series Wood 

product on the large fixed window with same brick mould and 

muntin sizes along with same TDL patio door at the other 

elevations. However, there may be an issue with sizing and 

structure on this particular fixed window and if so, Windsor has 

said their clad fixed window may be better options here .Examples of Windsor Pinnacle

Preference is for 2 door garage but due to setbacks, limited to single door option 

but choose a style that depict two doors. Carriage style wood (cedar) door that 

gives appearance of being 2 doors. Painted or stained. Side Door Awning: 

Forty -five degree concave 

curved roof section across the front with the 

ends at a steep angle to create a broader 

face across the top of the awning. Sweep comes 

standard with 4" x 1.5" valance. Metal 

Side Door :

Exterior Door, True divided lites with 

5/8” wood muntin (match windows), brick 

mould to match windows. 

Lights: 

1 Carriage light at side door 

2 Carriage lights on either side of garage 

Lights will likely be electric (considering gas) 

in either bronze or black Railing to match 

existing railing at home: 

Wrought Iron 

Balusters are ½” square 

Top Rail is 1 ½” flat 

Bottom Rail is 1 ½” flat 

End Posts are 1” x 1” square Pool Details: 

Approximately 12 X 12 Plunge Pool (examples shown) 

• Inground pool with 

approximately 12” stone coping 

• Pool equipment will be installed 

just beyond pool and semi 

screened by plants Natural Grade of Lot 

Front to back the lot has a natural downhill 

grade. Measured from the current finished 

floor at the rear of the home to the middle 

of the rear yard, there is approximately 7 ½ 

foot drop in elevation across this span to 

the lowest point. 

This allows the addition to connect 

naturally to the current home and grade 

which is 3 feet lower than current rear 

elevation. It maintains a minimal ridge line 

increase of 2 feet.
