Hi Donald and Karen, 

Thanks for the update. No one is asking you to remove one of the windows installed on your home to bring to next 

week's Commission meeting. I'll be glad to reach out to Champion and see if they can provide a sample. 

The WebEx information for next week's meeting will be sent out on Monday. 

Sincerely, 

Kristi

Hi Karen, 

Since your contractor is not available in November, I will officially defer this project to the December meeting. 

No, the Commission is absolutely not asking you to remove one of the installed window and bring it to a Commission 

meeting for their review. A window sample is being requested. Window companies do this all the time. 

An in ‐depth discussion about this request was held during the Commission meeting on October 11. The meeting is 

available for review on YouTube at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEwLrIYC4yc. Discussion of the request begins 

around the 1:55:00 mark of the meeting video. Additional discussion of the request is at time stamp 2:02:35. As 

stated “Champion should have a sample that they can provide of what was installed to bring to the Commission.” 

I recommend you reach out to your contractor who will be able to assist in obtaining a window sample from Champion. 

Sincerely, 

Kristi

Kristina ‐

I am struggling with the following: 2

"Provide a sample of the window product that was installed at 1615 The Plaza so the Commission can explore 

congruousness or not, and then the Commission can evaluate at that point with that information". 

Can you please clarify this statement? Is the committee requesting us to physically remove a window on the 

day of the meeting and carry it down to the government center for the meeting? If so, I am not comfortable 

with this. The weather is unpredictable, and it could be raining and/or very cold outside. If it is not possible 

for each committee member to enlarge the photos we have already provided, then please feel free to come to 

my house in person, like Jenny and another committee member did in July. I understand this may not be what 

is done on a typical working day for the HDC commission, but we are less than 2 miles from center city. Also, if 

one or two committee members review and provide testimony to the entire committee, and the HDC deems 

this unacceptable, then where is the "Trust in the Team" that so many companies rely on the get jobs done 

every day? 

I am interested to hear your thoughts on this and appreciate the consideration. It does not look like we will be 

ready for November, unless this sample contingency is satisfied in another way. Our contractor will be out of 

town in November and I do not have a clue as to how to remove a window from its frame myself. Maybe once 

the issue is discussed in your offsite for going forward projects, we can wait for that. 

Thank you, 

Karen Cates

Hi Karen, 

Thanks so much for sending over these photos. 

You let me know what you prefer. Are you able to obtain a window sample for the November meeting? If you need 

additional time, then I’m glad to put this application on the December agenda instead.

Hi Kristina ‐

These additional photos of current Plaza Midwood HD homes show windows that appear to be younger than 

30 years old when PM was first designated historical. If nothing else, they might be able to assist your 

committee in the window agenda discussion for your offsite retreat in November. If these arrive too late for 

the November HDC meeting, I am fine with postponing until December. 45

1611 The Plaza

This is right next door to our home, and the HDC approved it in 2019 as an accessory unit. It appears well over 

the 800 square foot limit, and the windows are from Champion Windows. They are aluminum, or some other 

metal, and in my opinion are not in keeping the historical nature of our neighborhood. My husband thought 

it safe in using Champion Windows since the HDC approved these sliding windows in 2019, and our contract 

was less than $15,000 anyway. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Respectfully,

## Information Submitted by the Public 

Jennifer and Scott Rea, Redwood Development Group 

1913 Cleveland Av December 12, 2023 

Dear Charlo Ʃe HDC Commissioners: 

We are the owners of 1913 Cleveland which is located one block from 1823 Cleveland. As stated 

in our November H DC Mee Ɵng comments, while we fully support the move of the Leeper Wya Ʃ

building to 1823 Cleveland, we do not support the roo Ōop addi Ɵon that is being proposed .

While we acknowledge the applicants’ con Ɵnued effort to revise the design of the r oo Ōop 

addi Ɵon , we sƟll do not believe the roo Ōop addi Ɵon complies with the following HDC Design Standards: 

Sec Ɵon 4.5: Rehabilita Ɵon of Building Elements – Roofs - Items 3 & 6 

Sec Ɵon 7.17: Commercial Addi Ɵons - Items 1, 2, 5 & 6 

We believe the basement and rear addi Ɵon elem ents of this project are fully compa Ɵble with 

the HDC Design Standards. If addi Ɵonal square footage beyond those addi Ɵons is necessary to make 

this project viable, we believe that square footage should be added to the rear of the building not to 

the roof. The glass and metal structure currently being proposed to be built on top of the historic Leeper 

Wya Ʃ building is approximately 850 square feet. Th at addi Ɵonal square footage cou ld instead be added 

to the rear of the building by extending the rear addi Ɵon across the full width of the building and 

housing any building equipment on the roof as is very common for commercial buildings with flat roofs. 

We do not believe a non-essen Ɵal 850 SF roo Ōop addi Ɵon post-reloca Ɵon of t he Leeper Wya Ʃ

building should qualify for special considera Ɵon to HDC Design Standards. We believe that all elements 

of this project should be considered precedent se ƫng , and we do not believe that the HDC would 

consider this type of addi Ɵon to any other flat roof commercial building in the Dilworth Historic District .

To reiterate the ques Ɵon that we posed back in November, how would you respond to a 

comparable addi Ɵon to Dilworth Tas Ɵng Room (300 E Tremont, built 1945), Ed’s Tavern (2200 Park Rd, 

built 1924), the Paper Skyscraper/Thai Taste building (324-300 East Blvd, built 1939), or any other flat 

roof, brick historic building in the Dilworth Historic District? 

Finally, we believe the glass storefront and brick parapet details of the historic Leeper Wya Ʃ

building are its defining architectural elements. Limi Ɵng your approval for this project to all elements 

other than the roo Ōop addi Ɵon will ensure that the storefront and parapet elements remain the focal 

points and that this project complies with HDC Design Standards. 

Sincerely, 

Sco Ʃ & Jennifer Rea
