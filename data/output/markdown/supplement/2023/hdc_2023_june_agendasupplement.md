My name is Russell Ruckterstuhl and I have been a resident of Dilworth for 29 years. Proposed project HDCCMA-2023-00115 is within sight of my home on East Worthington Ave. I am against approval of this new construction / addition proposal for the following reasons: (page of Historic District Design Standard for reference) 1. Massing and Complexity of Form (7.7) The subject project does not adequately address massing and complexity of form to fit in with the adjacent historic buildings. The east and west elevations of the new building are simple, flat surfaces without any complexity. The east elevation along Kenilworth is also flat with minimal rhythm provided by a change in exterior finish. None of the massing mimics any of the form from adjacent historic buildings with projecting bays, dormers, etc. The building is nothing more than a simple, plain box you would expect from a suburban motel. 2. Scale (7.9) The subject project does not include any design elements that provide a human scale for the building . The building should include elements typical to the surrounding context such as porches or one story projections to bring the building into scale with the surrounding neighborhood. None of these elements are included in the current design. 3. Orientation (7.6) This proposal does not orient the entrance to the street. The existing building does not have and entrance from Charlotte drive. The applicant incorrectly states that there is a “recessed off-center entry on Charlotte Drive” - this access has been removed. The main hotel entrance is directly from the parking lot on the side of the building and it not accessible by pedestrians from Charlotte Drive. This is important since the property is planning to utilize on-street parking. 4. Spacing (7.5) The subject project does not provide spacing between the existing and new structure along Ideal way that matches the historic pattern in the immediate surroundings of the new construction. There is approximately 10’ between the new and existing buildings - much less than between other buildings in the immediate area. This adds to the massing and scale of the project from Ideal Way making the building spacing unlike the surrounding historic properties. 5. Lighting (8.12) The subject project existing parking lot includes a sodium pole light and single light over the parking lot building entrance. The building along Charlotte Drive and Ideal Way is dark without any exterior lights. The subject project does not address lighting in their documentation. The design standards sate that new listing should be dark sky compliant, downward directed, and fully shielded. Also, bright security lighting mounted at eve heights of buildings should be avoided and any security lighting must be downward directed. 6. Parking (8.3) The subject project has the parking lot in the side yard is prominent when approaching the property from the north on Charlotte drive. There is no screening provided to the north of the parking lot and the screening of the parking lot from Charlotte drive is limited at ground level. In general, please note that the existing building is a commercial building less than 50 years old. The existing building can not 

be considered as “context” for new construction per page 3.29. The same goes for the three condominium buildings to the north on Charlotte Drive. Just because the existing building and surrounding non-historic buildings do not meet the historic district standards it does not mean that this building expansion is exempt from their requirements. When compared to the historic structures surrounding the property, this proposed design is not up to these standards. In addition to these design issues there are other issues with this project such as the removal of mature trees and the increase in non-permeable area. Due to all of these issues with the proposed project, please consider voting “against” this proposal. Thank you, Russell Ruckterstuhl 1227 E.

A ttention: Marilyn Drath and the City of Charlotte Historic District Commission: 

I’m writing today, as a Charlotte Drive neighbor, to voice my opposition to the proposed expansion of the building on PID: 12111901 located at 1921 Charlotte Drive. As a fellow steward of historic Dilworth, I wanted to provide input. I’m unable to attend Wednesday’s (4/12/23) HDC meeting, but have a vested interest in balancing progress while respecting and maintaining historic standards. 

The proposed design lacks many of the core elements and details that have helped to preserve the historic charm that characterizes the Dilworth neighborhood. 

1. First, the proposed design does not take into consideration the preservation of green space, nor does it respect the neighborhood’s (and city’s) mission to maintain a large tree canopy. a. The proposed building addition and 6 new parking spaces increase the impervious surface area on the lot. b. The proposed structure would require the removal of 3 mature trees on Dilworth’s historic edge. If we don’t maintain historic standards in preserving the edges of the historic district, it will continue to shrink. 2. The density created by the proposed addition, by comparison, is incongruent with other single family homes on Charlotte Drive and adjacent streets, and is not complementary to the streetscape. a. The size of two large structures on the property erodes the pedestrian feel and scale that exists throughout the neighborhood. 

b. When transitioning from single family to denser development, the historic context surrounding the site must be respected (height, massing, roof forms, materials, etc.) 3. Lastly, the proposed design package lacks a site dimensioning plan, making it difficult to know, specifically, the size and scale of what is being proposed. 

I’m grateful for your consideration and partnership in preservation. 

Best, Brooke

Hello, my name is Scott Cottrill and I live at 1219 East Worthington Ave in Dilworth, very close in proximity to the proposed location where an expansion is proposed to an existing micro-hotel. 

First, safety is my #1 consideration. We enjoy living in an area where neighbors are actually friendly and our children feel safe. 

The existing location was originally built as a “half-way house” with very limited rooms, approximately 8. Later, it became a business and renting rooms by the night, approximately 17. The new proposed expansion will allow 33 rentals per night. 

This by no means should be approved and without doubt does not make sense to allow in a historic neighborhood. If approved, why not allow corporations to buy homes, demolish, and later construct 2, 5 or even 10 story complexes for businesses. Our neighborhood and children do not need more transient people that could lead to crime and go against the values of a historic district. We are not only speaking out aesthetics of the buildings, we are talking about the residents and their well being. 

Also it appears the building owners propose to cut down at least 3 large oak trees. I thought we were in favor of keeping our beautiful trees. This type of business goes against our density and mass guidelines. And lastly, we have yet to see exact dimensions of the proposed construction which is important as a community member to fully understand, even for consideration. 

With all due respect, I would ask that the proposed project NOT BE APPROVED. I understand this is a tough job for you all, but please help our community be safe and remain a “neighborhood.” Sincerely, Scott M. Cottrill

Hi Kristi and Marilyn, I was unsure of whom to send my comments regarding Case # HDCCMA-2023-00115 / 1921 Charlotte Dr, so I am sending to both of you. Please note that I am also trying to clear my schedule on Wednesday afternoon so that I may attend the HDC hearing in person to speak against approval of this project...I will email Marilyn before 10am on Wednesday to pre-register for the hearing, either in person or via WebEx. My comments regarding Case # HDCCMA-2023-00115 are as follows: As a property owner within 300 feet of 1921 Charlotte Dr, I strongly oppose approval of the proposed project for multiple reasons. First, the existing structure is already incongruent with the neighborhood, and is surrounded by mostly single-family homes that are contributing structures to the historic district; adding another incongruent structure on this property would only compound and highlight the inconsistency. Secondly, doubling the capacity of this hotel in our residential neighborhood would drastically impact the population density in this area (again, which is mostly comprised of many single-family homes). Thirdly, the proposed loss of mature trees to accommodate the project would negatively affect the tree canopy of the neighborhood. And, finally and most importantly, the ratio of non-permeable surfaces to permeable surfaces in the proposed plan does not appear to be appropriate or consistent with the standards that are imposed on the adjacent properties. 

Note: my home (which I am currently in the process of renovating, adhering to plans that were approved by the HDC in November 2021) is directly across the street from the proposed project at 1921 Charlotte Dr. Thank you in advance for considering my concerns.

Please click the Phish Alert button to forward the email to Bad.Mail. Kristina-We are the residents of 1238 E Worthington Avenue; therefore our backyard is immediately adjacent the subject property. We respectfully oppose the proposed addition on several grounds: - the existing structure is already completely out of character and scale with the adjacent 1-1.5 story residential structures. The mass of the current structure is mitigated somewhat by the offset from existing property lines and the lawn/trees between the property boundaries and the building. - the aforementioned mitigating elements would be destroyed by the proposed addition, and the mass (ie scale) and post-modern visual incongruity would be greatly exacerbated by the expansion. - the building already rests at a low point for storm water migration through the neighborhood, the loss of permeable land will likely deteriorate the already flood-prone geography.

Please click the Phish Alert button to forward the email to Bad.Mail. Dear Kristi and Charlotte Historic District committee, As a resident of the Dilworth neighborhood and an adjacent neighbor, I’m writing about the 1921 Charlotte Drive proposal to add a second structure to the Kasa Edison Hotel site at the corner of Charlotte Drive and Ideal Way. This structure was built in 1992 and operated by Hope Haven as a halfway house with a capacity of 9 residents. This facility was a well received and peaceful addition to our neighborhood. The same structure is being currently utilized to house 17 people with the proposed structure to add an additional 16 people for a total of 33 people on a site that originally operated with less than a third of that amount. The building size and design elements do not fit with the human scale of the surrounding historic structures. This proposed project includes removal of three mature trees, one willow oak and two pecan trees. Our tree canopy is losing ground to constant development, as much as we can maintain our tree canopy without cutting down healthy trees, we will preserve a healthier space for the humans that reside and work in our community. The property at 1921 Charlotte Drive has a parking lot made of asphalt, the current structure and the addition of the proposed structure would almost double the footprint on this property. The addition of this second structure would lessen the permeability of this property, lessen the ability of rainwater to be absorbed on this site and increase the potential for runoff and flooding in the surrounding area. Please carefully consider this opportunity to protect this boundary property and maintain the integrity of our community. Heather Ruckterstuhl 1227 E.

Regarding the April 12, 2023 meeting of the HDC addressing the expansion of the motel at 1921 Charlotte Drive: as a resident living adjacent to the property I am dismayed at the possibility of the expansion passing. What was previously a halfway house for 9 residents (approved and welcome by the neighborhood in 1992) has grown and changed to a motel with a 17 rooms. Now the owners have petitioned the HDC to allow an additional building to be added that would expand the property to 33 rooms. This expansion would not only supersede the city permeability requirements by adding a new building and expanding the parking lot by 6 spaces, it would require the removal of THREE LARGE MATURE OAK TREES. Please consider the impact of the increased density on the neighborhood as well as the 2 other issues noted above. Thank You. Rachel Hewitt Information Submitted by the Public

Hello Kristina and Marilyn, 

We are reaching out regarding Case # HDCCMA-2023-00115 / 1921 Charlotte Drive. 

As a property owners three houses from 1921 Charlotte Dr, we strongly oppose approval of the proposed project for several reasons: The existing structure is already incongruent with the neighborhood and is surrounded by mostly single-family homes that are contributing structures to the historic district; adding another incongruent structure on this property would only compound and highlight the inconsistency. Doubling the capacity of this hotel in our residential neighborhood would drastically impact the population density in this area (again, which is mostly comprised of many single-family homes). 

The proposed loss of mature trees to accommodate the project would negatively affect the tree canopy of the neighborhood. 

Importantly, the ratio of non-permeable surfaces to permeable surfaces in the proposed plan does not appear to be appropriate or consistent with the standards that are imposed on the adjacent properties. Unfortunately, the current ownership does not do a good job keeping the property tidy….trash and yard debris are not maintained on a regular basis. We are concerned about street parking in an already congested area if these plans were approved. 

Kay plans to attend either via WebEx on in person. 

Thank you for accepting our input on this matter.

Hi Kristi, 

I am writing to express my thoughts regarding the above-referenced case. My comments are as follows: As a property owner within 400 feet of 1921 Charlotte Dr, I strongly oppose the approval of the proposed project for multiple reasons. First, the existing structure is already incongruent with the neighborhood, and is surrounded by mostly single-family homes that are contributing structures to the historic district; adding another incongruent structure on this property would only compound and highlight the inconsistency. Second, doubling the capacity of this hotel in our residential neighborhood would drastically impact the population density in this area (again, which is mostly comprised of many single-family homes). Third, the proposed loss of mature trees to accommodate the project would negatively affect the tree canopy of the neighborhood. And, finally and most importantly, the ratio of non-permeable surfaces to permeable surfaces in the proposed plan does not appear to be appropriate or consistent with the standards that are imposed on the adjacent properties. 

I am trying to clear my schedule on Wednesday afternoon so that I may attend the HDC hearing in person to speak against approval of this project...I will email Marilyn before 10 am on Wednesday to pre-register for the hearing, either in person or via WebEx. Thank you in advance for considering my concerns.

Good Evening Kristi, I am writing in regards to the hearing that is taking place on April 12, 2023 regarding 

HDCCMA-2023-00115 for the property located at 1921 Charlotte Drive. I am against the agenda item as it does not meet the historical district standards and adds a new type of building to the area that doesn't match other buildings (residential and non-residential in the area). 

First off, the massing and complexity of the new construction doesn't match existing adjacent historic buildings, as noted in section 7.7 of the historic standards. This would introduce a new building with complex massing. Secondly, the removal of 3 large mature trees is concerning as it would remove a portion of the lush garden-like atmosphere that is in much of the historic Dilworth district. These large trees help play a role in energy conservation on the property and the surrounding areas. These large trees that would be removed would rid the area of the historic trees that help define the area. The replacement of these trees in other areas of the property would take 20-40 years to get to the mature age and height of the current trees. The tree removal would continue to hurt the mature population that we continue to lose every year due to various reasons. Last, this new building would appear to go against the 50% impermeable material in the rear yard. 

Thank you for your consideration of these facts and I look forward to the result of the hearing. --
