I strongly oppose the plan at 1509 Belvedere. This man came in and had people tearing off asbestos siding with ZERO protection exposing them (and my son and I who live next door) to asbestos. It was not taken off properly. It was cracked etc. His submission does not even show our house as being the one next to his. Also, he has let the house sit with rotting wood, weeds overtaking the backyard, animals running around, etc. I strongly hope his plan is denied and/or that his removal of the remaining asbestos siding is painstakingly monitored.

My wife and I are very excited about the plans for the new restaurant in the former Bontera space as well as their 

plans for the Leeper building. I think we should be happy this couple has taken this stressful project on their 

shoulders to help make our Dilworth even better. 

We own commercial land beside this project on Worthington and will be working with the owners to help with 

evening parking. We have reviewed their complete plans and are in full support of this project. The rooftop 

solarium is going to be quite a hangout spot for everyone. We think the materials used for the solarium will only 

enhance the building. The options provided show other older buildings in the city that have added a solarium and 

for us we believe it to only be a positive aesthetic. We hope y ou will approve this move of the Leeper building so 

not only Dilworth can enjoy it but all those that for sure will be heading to Dilworth to enjoy this positive addition.

Our firm owns property across the street from the former Bonterra location. We understand the 

Leeper Wyatt buildin g may be relocated to the parking field of the former Bonterra building. 

We have reviewed the proposed relocation plan in detail and we are enthusiastically supportive of this 

relocation and preservation effort. In particular, the solarium is a remark able feature that we feel will 

enhance the building dramatically, while still honoring it’s historic legacy. We view this effort as adding 

to the wonderful historic context of the site, and adding to the fabric of historic Dilworth. Thank you for 

worki ng with the petitioner to advance this proposal, we hope that HDC shares our view of this 

project. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.

Please let this letter serve as our support of petitioner’s plan and request. I have reviewed the plan in detail and believe the height, scale, and massing to be in historical context with the immediate surroundings and the original structure located on the property. We feel strongly that the HDC shall consider that through the actions of the city of charlotte zoning commission and their ordinance that Cleveland Avenue has become the bookend and entrance into the historic district up against large scale mixed development. This development pattern has led to project’s with larger height’s, larger mass, and appropriate use’s that transition from the larger light rail district into the district. This project is in keeping with this reality and precedents for projects approved by the commission along the Cleveland Avenue bookend into the district. Kindly, J.

Dear Sarah ,

You requested a letter stating the DCA Land Use committee’s position on the lease language 

issue that resulted in our opposition at the September public hearing of rezoning petition 

2023 -088 . The DCA Land Use committee has reviewed the latest site plan which contains the 

off -site lease language we suggested on Aug. 21 st . The inclusion of that enforceable lease 

language removes the obstacle that caused us to oppose the petition at the Sept.11 th public 

hearing. 

Sincerely,

Contractor Failure Rate Report 

## Mecklenburg County 

NOTE: Where this report refers to failed inspections, in no case are certificates of occupancy for any project issued until all detected code defects are corrected. 

The data system has been tested and found to be highly reliable. For contractors as a group, over 46,000 of the 108,000 inspections performed during the 3rd quarter of 2006 were tested for accuracy in reporting, and no errors were found. 

For contactors with 7 or more inspections in a quarter, with a confidence level of 99%, the probability that the reported inspection failure rate is within 2% of the true failure rate is at least 99.5%. 

For contractors with fewer than 7 inspections in a quarter, neither total failed nor a percentage of total failed inspections are reported because such measures based on a small number of inspections are sensitive to errors and hence could be misleading.

Hi Kristi, Apologies for the multiple emails, but I wanted to pass along some more last minute information. It would appear that 1224 Myrtle Ave also has solar panels installed on a detached garage. Renu also installed solar on the Capizzi doctors office located at 900 East Blvd that appears to fall within the Historic District boundary.

Thanks for confirming, Kristi. I also wanted to touch base with you about the logistics of the meeting Wednesday since I will be joining remotely. I will have at least one other coworker join the call in case of a technical problem and am wondering if that will be an issue. I am also curious about the timeframe of this meeting and if it is recommended that we are on the call for the duration of the slated 6 hours. I also wanted to pass along the following notes the homeowners would like us to share with the historic district: 1) Part of the project is on a detached non-contributing structure that no neighbors can see 

2) there are other houses in our neighborhood which have solar panels. The Commission will want to know specific addresses of these properties. 

3) solar panels significantly improve the environmental sustainability of our house which reduces the carbon footprint for us and our neighborhood at no cost to our neighbors 

4) we are in a historic district and subject to all of their rules, but a reminder that our house itself is non-historic (built in 1953). This house is considered historic to the local historic district and the Commission, as it is older than 50 years and is mid-century modern architecture. 

5) we have identified at least one other home in the near vicinity (on Berkeley between Carlton and Lafayette) that has solar panels on the back roof - this is kind of visible from the road behind (Romany) in the summer and definitely in the winter. What is the address of this property? 

6) Provides jobs to a local Charlotte company in a tech and sustainable business 

Best, Claire
