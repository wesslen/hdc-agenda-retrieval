## Multi -family Precedent – Kingston on West Townhomes Proposed Development – “Gateway” Apartment Complex Proposed towers will be 

significantly visible from 

different pedestrian 

viewpoints. 

This will undermine the 

Historic Wilmore School 

and the context of the 

neighborhood. 

## Proposed Development – “Gateway” Apartment Complex Proposed Development – Townhomes on W. Kingston Scale of the Proposed Development on West Kingston does NOT respect immediate historic context of 

neighboring homes.

1913 Cleveland Av November 6, 2023 

Dear Charlo Ʃe HDC Commissioners: 

We are the owners of 1913 Cleveland which is located one block from 1823 Cleveland. We strongly 

support the move of the Leeper Wya Ʃ building to the Dilworth Historic District. During this project’s 

recent rezoning process, we sent a le Ʃer of support to all City Council members expressing our support 

for the pe ƟƟ on. 

We also support the below grade basement level addi Ɵon as well as the rear addi Ɵon to the building. 

We believe these aspects of the proposed project fully align with HDC Design Standards. 

We would love to be able to support the proposed project in full, but we are truly struggling to see how 

the roo Ōop addi Ɵon that is currently being proposed aligns with HDC Design Standards. 

The proposed project is a combina Ɵon of a move, a rehab , and an addi Ɵon. There are several sec Ɵons 

of the HDC Design Standards that we believe should apply to this project, but do not currently align 

with the project as currently designed. 

The first sec Ɵon is Sec Ɵon 4.5: Rehabilita Ɵon of Building Elements – Roofs: 

3 - Do not add skylights unless placed inconspicuously. Skylights must be flush mount and must not 

impact the roof system. Repair of roof materials and elements should be made in-kind with materials 

that duplicate the original materials. 

6 - Place skylights, solar collectors, satellite dishes, and other antennae on less visible loca Ɵons of the 

roof. No changes to the roof structure should be made to accommodate these elements. 

These two design standards clearly discourage visible skylights within historic districts. The proposed 

roo Ōop addi Ɵon is essen Ɵally an en Ɵre roof made up of con Ɵnuous skylights. This commercial skylight 

system will definitely be visible from the street and from various other neighboring buildings within the 

district. 

We are unaware of any precedent projects within Charlo Ʃe’s historic districts for this type of addi Ɵon. 

The 229 N Church Street addi Ɵon that the applicants have provided as the sole example within one of 

Charlo Ʃe’s historic districts has the same flat commercial roof as the historic por Ɵon of that building. 

While that addi Ɵon does include more glass than the historic por Ɵons of the building, th at glass is in 

the form of more tradi Ɵonal windows /doors rather than in the form of skylights. That addi Ɵon was also 

part of a larger project in the early 2000’s that added a second building next to the historic building. In 

that case, the addi Ɵon act ed as a connector between the new 5-story building and the historic 3-story 

building. We believe the 1823 Cleveland proposed addi Ɵon’s materials and placement on a freestanding 

building are much too different from the 229 N Church Street addi Ɵon to consider it as evidence to 

support approval. The second sec Ɵon we see compa Ɵbility issues with is Sec Ɵon 7.17: Commercial Addi Ɵons . We do not 

believe the third-story addi Ɵon as currently designed meets these standards: 

1 - AƩempt to locate the addi Ɵon on the rear eleva Ɵon so that it is minimally visible from the street. 

2 - Limit the size of the addi Ɵon so that it does not visually overpower the exis Ɵng historic building. 

5 - Maintain the exis Ɵng roof pitch. Roof lines for new addi Ɵons should be secondary to those of the 

exis Ɵng structure. Typically, the original roof as visible from the public right -of-way should not be raised. 

6 - Make sure that the design of a new addi Ɵon is compa Ɵble with the exis Ɵng building. The new work 

should be differen Ɵated from the old while being compa Ɵble with its massing, form, scale, direc Ɵonal 

expression, roof forms, and materials, founda Ɵon, fenestra Ɵon, and materials. 

We believe consistency in the approval process from project to project is of utmost importance to 

maintaining the integrity of the HDC. There are many flat roof historic commercial buildings located 

within Charlo Ʃe’s historic districts. When you consider this applica Ɵon, we would encourage you to 

think about those buildings as well. If you approve this type of roo Ōop addi Ɵon, how would you jus Ɵfy 

saying no in the fu ture when a similar addi Ɵon comes before the commission ? How would you approach 

an applica Ɵon for a comparable addi Ɵon to Dilworth Tas Ɵng Room (300 E Tremont, built 1945), Ed’s 

Tavern (2200 Park Rd, built 1924), the Paper Skyscraper/Thai Taste building (324-300 East Blvd, built 

1939), or any other flat roof, brick historic building in the Dilworth Historic District? 

If you needed to make a minor excep Ɵon to a design standard in order to accommodate the move and 

reloca Ɵon of the Leeper Wya Ʃ building, we can certainly see how that could reasonably be considered 

non-precedent se ƫng . We do not, however, believe a non-essen Ɵal roo Ōop addi Ɵon post-reloca Ɵon 

should qualify for any special considera Ɵon. We hope that you will con Ɵnue to work with these 

applicants to revise their applica Ɵon to fully align with HDC Design Standards. 

Sincerely, 

Sco Ʃ & Jennifer Rea
