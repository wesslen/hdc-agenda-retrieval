HDC Staff, I would like to submit comments for the agenda supplement for next week's meeting. My comments are concerning the signage application for 1515 S Mint, specifically The Horseshoe. 

I noticed the latest application does not have any information about how The Horseshoe's sign is currently lit / will be lit. The current sign is made of plastic, glows from within and is incredibly bright. 

It is stated in the Appendix A that "signs may not flash, blink, or glow from within". It also states "Only suitable materials, such as stone, wood, brick, and sturdy metals, will be approved." Backlit plastic signage is perfectly fine for an Applebees on Independence Boulevard, it is not acceptable in a historic neighborhood, please do not approve something so out of place. 

I have attached a picture of the sign at night. 

Thank you, 

Cam

Kristi and Marilyn, 

Our comments regarding Case # HDCCMA-2023-00115 are as follows: 

For nearly twenty years we have lived and owned a house on Ideal Way that is two lots away from 1921 Charlotte Drive and are writing to express our strong opposition to the proposed expansion/project at this address. There are a number of concerns we have with the project: 

- This property in its current state (with architectural features very inconsistent with Historical Dilworth) is already a negative factor on the historical charm of our neighborhood and adding to/expanding it will only increase this issue. 

- The current use of the property as a hotel has already caused a significant increase in car traffic and litter/trash in the neighborhood, increasing the structure for greater occupancy will only exacerbate these problems. 

- A small hotel in a non-historical building is already inconsistent with Historical Dilworth and the envisioned larger one would be even more inconsistent. 

- The current treescape at 1921 Charlotte Drive partially masks some of the issues with the current structure and the planned removal of some or all of these trees would further highlight this non-historical property. 

- In the twenty years we have been in Dilworth the runoff from rain has become a significant issue that at times overwhelms the drainage (with one of the frequent problem areas being at the intersection of Ideal Way and Charlotte Drive); further development on this property will increase this already thorny problem.

Shannon and Brad Brown

## Dilworth Community Association The DCA oppose s application HDCCMA -2023 -00115 for 1921 Charlotte Drive for the following reasons: 

Context – the overall relationship of the project to its surroundings 

The parcel is surrounded by Bungalows and American Small Houses on the north and east side ; t he 

other th ree commercial buildings on Charlotte Dr. to the nort h are less than 50 years old and would not 

be considered as context for a new building in the historic districts. After searching around Dilworth we 

have determined that there is no example of two exterior stair cases as shown, nor the multiple exterior 

door s as depicted on the courtyard elevation of this new building , therefore this new building does not 

meet the HDC standard requirement for context. 

ORIENTATION - the direction in which the front of the building faces 

It is unclear what the primary street is for this new building, whether it is Ideal Way or Kenilworth. It is 

also unclear where the front entrance is, therefore this new building does not meet the HDC standard 

requirement for orientation. 

Two additional conce rns are that the width of the new building appears to be greater than the existing 

building, but since t here are no measurements shown on the site plan that is difficult to ascertain , as is 

the distance between the two buildings. We also remain concerned about the removal of heritage trees. 

As mentioned in the July meeting, a very serious concern with this project after the HDC review are the 

zoning issues that will present themselves if significant changes are not made to this plan. Realizing that 

zoning issues are outside of the HDC’s purview we will not discuss those at this point in time. Information Submitted by the Public

Good morning and hope you are doing well today. I am again voicing my concern about the proposed construction located at 1921 Charlotte Drive . 

I have lived across the street from this property since 1988 and have enjoyed the beautiful Oak trees on their property that shield the traffic on Kenilworth and my view of the condos and shopping center. The proposed project would cut down three mature Oak Trees that would take many decades to replicate. These trees make our historic neighborhood beautiful and can't be replaced during my lifetime. I highly encourage you not to cut down these healthy beautiful trees. 

Other concerns for this project are the size/mass of this project which is out of character with our neighborhood. Water runoff is a concern as this is an unmanned hotel and they do not monitor or clean their storm drains by the entrance. Water frequently backs up on Charlotte Drive and is a great concern to cars driving through this water. 

I appreciate your help

This is Nick and Tiffany Linville of 2016 Charlotte Drive. We are emailing with regard to the hotel expansion at Ideal Way and Charlotte Drive which we feel will negatively impact Dilworth, and particularly the immediate vicinity for a number of reasons that we believe should encourage you to prevent this expansion. 

Firstly, it will result in losses to our urban forest at a time when climate change is a deep concern in Charlotte and beyond. 

Secondly, it will inevitably increase traffic along Charlotte Drive which I have already (and repeatedly) requested the city install speed bumps or other signage to protect our children and all of us (but to no avail). 

Thirdly, Dilworth's historic district already is falling victim to the ceaseless expansion of the hospital and adjacent commercial areas. Our residents have done a lot to retain the integrity of the district by following the HDCs rules. Now we are facing this again with this hotel expansion. When will it end? 

Finally, the applicant/owner already has a record of frankly not taking care of this property. Dilworth neighbors have, on their own volition, repeatedly and regularly cut the weeds behind their property along Kenilworth, primarily in the name of safety because the owners let them grow so large that it impossible to see to the left when turning right onto Kenilworth from Ideal Way. 

I regret that we cannot attend the meeting because we both have to work. Please let our concerns be known. Thank you for your time.

Hi Kristi and Marilyn, 

I was unsure of whom to send my comments regarding Case # HDCCMA-2023-00115 / 1921 Charlotte Dr, so I am sending to both of you. Please note that I am also trying to clear my schedule on Wednesday afternoon so that I may attend the HDC hearing in person to speak against approval of this project...I will email Marilyn before 10am on Wednesday to pre-register for the hearing, either in person or via WebEx. 

My comments regarding Case # HDCCMA-2023-00115 are as follows: 

As a property owner within 300 feet of 1921 Charlotte Dr, I strongly oppose approval of the proposed project for multiple reasons. First, the existing structure is already incongruent with the neighborhood, and is surrounded by mostly single-family homes that are contributing structures to the historic district; adding another incongruent structure on this property would only compound and highlight the inconsistency. Secondly, doubling the capacity of this hotel in our residential neighborhood would drastically impact the population density in this area (again, which is mostly comprised of many single-family homes). Thirdly, the proposed loss of mature trees to accommodate the project would negatively affect the tree canopy of the neighborhood. And, finally and most importantly, the ratio of non-permeable surfaces to permeable surfaces in the proposed plan does not appear to be appropriate or consistent with the standards that are imposed on the adjacent properties. 

Note: my home (which I am currently in the process of renovating, adhering to plans that were approved by the HDC in November 2021) is directly across the street from the proposed project at 1921 Charlotte Dr. 

Thank you in advance for considering my concerns.

Hi Marilyn, 

My name is Shannon Wilcox. My husband and I reside at 2005 Charlotte Drive and are very concerned about the requests for 1921 Charlotte Drive (PID:12111901). We have reached out on this topic before. We are both unable to attend Wednesday's live meeting due to work. but our concerns are as follows: 

First and foremost, we love our neighborhood. We love the people, the walkability and the beautiful tree canopy. If it weren't for Dilworth's tree canopy I'm not entirely sure our dog would be getting as many walks as he does in the growing, summer heat. I recently read an article stating that Charlotte was losing three football fields of trees a day: 

https://treescharlotte.org/news/treescharlotte-canopy-study-shows-sharp-decline/ 

This is very concerning to us. Not only do trees provide beauty and cooling of streets, but they help slow the gas buildup in our atmosphere that has been rapidly warming our planet. They simply help us live healthier lives. We consider ourselves realists and support economic growth in this city and neighborhood we call home, but unnecessary removal of the tree canopy seems nothing short of irresponsible at this point. 

Along with losing parts of the tree canopy concerning the case for 1921 Charlotte Drive, it also raises concerns for our very regular neighborhood walkers, bikers and runners. Charlotte Drive is a bit of a narrow street. Traffic can be concerning, especially around the Ideal Way and Charlotte Drive intersection. Several studies show that more trees reduce traffic speeds and crashes, as they create vertical wall frames that provide a motorist edge and guide traffic. They create increased security, safety with medians and drainage on the neighborhood's infrastructure. 

We hope our concerns, along with the concerns of our lovely neighbors, are factored into the decision for the request of an addition that would result in removal of our beautiful, and often necessary, trees. 

Thank you so much for your time and consideration,

Please accept this Letter of Support for Application : HDCRMI-2023-00377 

My wife and I have lived in Dilworth for 35 years and have called 317 East Park Avenue our home since 1994. 

I fully support the Applicant’s proposal for the proposed additions and improvements. In addition to the outstanding landscape and hardscape improvements made to date, these proposed updates will further enhance the character of the Gilcrest-Gautier House. I feel strongly that these improvements are within the context of the block, and the Dilworth Historic District. 

As the co-owner of the home directly across the street from the subject property, I could not be more pleased and supportive of this Application. 

My travel schedule prohibits my ability to attend the hearing in person, but please read this letter at the hearing and enter it as part of the record. Should you wish to speak to me in advance of the hearing, please call my mobile number below.

Thank you Mike On Aug 6, 2023, at 7:50 PM, Sam Skains <snskains@gmail.com> wrote: 

Kristi and Marilyn, Thank you again for the scheduling information for the proposed development at the Wilmore School lot. Below are my written comments and attached is evidence on HDCCMA-2023-00283 for the proposed development. For signing up to attend/speak via WebEx at the August 9th HDC meeting, my name is Samantha N. Skains-Menchaca (homeowner at 417 West Kingston Ave. adjacent to the Wilmore School), and my email address is snskains@gmail.com. 

1. WILMORE NEIGHBORHOOD : As an initial matter, the proposed development is primarily for 270 multi-family units, the tallest portion being visually six (6) stories from each the curb on West Kingston Ave. and the curb on South Mint St. and the width being "approximately 75’ long on West Blvd, 360’ long on Mint St and 300’ long on Kingston Ave." The design of the proposed development is the very type of large, block-style apartment complex that significantly undermines the character of a historic district. As explicitly stated in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission’s Wilmore Small Area / Special Project Plan at http://ww.charmeck.org/Planning/Land%20Use%20Planning/Wilmore.pdf ("to be used as a general policy guide for land use decisions in the Wilmore neighborhood"), “the single family character of Wilmore [is] threatened by intensification and the encroachment of nonresidential uses”. Additionally, with respect to the existing Wilmore School building itself, new developments must 

“[l]imit the size of the addition so that it does not visually overpower the existing building.” (Sections 6.20 and 7.17 of the CHDDS). - There are about 550 lots in the Historic Wilmore, the sister neighborhood to Historic Dilworth, with the vast majority of the lots being 1.5- and 2-story single-family homes: "Wilmore mirrors the single-family Bungalows and wide curvilinear streets and sidewalks of Dilworth and shared the streetcar line from the center of town with this sister neighborhood.” (Section 3.7 of the CHDDS). 

Historic Wilmore is not at all akin to Historic Fourth Ward, where there are several multi-story buildings. There is not a single building in Historic Wilmore that is more than three (3) stories .2. CONTEXT ON WEST KINGSTON AVE. : West Kingston Ave. between South Mint St. and South Tryon St. only has single-family homes with a few duplexes and fourplexes -- no apartment buildings, churches, or commercial buildings. In fact, the Wilmore School lot on West Kingston Ave. was historically seven (7) separate parcels, as evidenced by the 1929 Sanborn Insurance Map, Volume One, Page 46. "New multi-family buildings should respect historic lot lines and parcel sizes. For multi-family buildings that are more than one lot width on the primary elevation and street, the mass of the building should be modulated with a material change and/or architectural change that creates a break in the wall plane to emulate the spacing of existing historic buildings.” (Section 6.6 of the CHDDS; See also Section 7.3 of the CHDDS). 

Additionally, “[m]ulti-family developments with more than four units will need to employ techniques for breaking down the mass and modulating the facades to appear as separate structures in order to have the new development fit the scale of the existing historic context.” (Section 6.8 of the CHDDS). Specifically on West Kingston Ave., the MASSING AND SPACING of the proposed development needs to be broken down to fit the neighborhood context of the 1.5- and 2-story single-family homes on separate parcels (seven (7) to be specific). 

3. HEIGHT: Absolutely no height above 49’-6” from curb is permissible any where for the proposed development, certainly not the proposed 65’ feet from “average curb” (What exactly is “average curb”?). "The height of a proposed building should be no taller than the tallest historic building on the block within a 360-degree range of visibility of the same type. The height of the historic structure should be calculated from the original historic ridge line, not any later additions that may be taller.” (Section 7.8 of the CHDDS). From curb, the Wilmore School building is 42’-6”, while the Calvary United Methodist Church building is 43’-10”. The accompanying building to this Church (which is not actually visible from the Wilmore School lot) is 49’-6” from curb. If this building is nevertheless accepted within the 360-degree range, this is the tallest historic building, and certainly no building proposed on the Wilmore School lot is permitted to be taller than 49’-6” from curb. - While the applicant alleges that “[t]he tallest 5 floor portion of the building (54-5’ above grade, max 65’ above average curb) will only be located at the center of the site and will have limited visibility from surrounding frontages”, this is not accurate. First, that tallest portion is actually 6 floors visually from the curb on each West Kingston Ave. and South Mint St. Second, 

the renderings provided by the applicant cherry-pick a select few angles at frontages where the proposed tallest portion may not be visible or only slightly visible. From the majority of angles (which are materially omitted by the applicant), the proposed tallest portion will be significantly visible, towering over adjacent 1.5 and 2-story single-family homes. The applicant needs to provide more renderings, at different sights/angles relative to the existing historic context (with height measurements), as well as with specific design details (window, doors, lighting, etc). 

4. SETBACK: For the proposed development on West Kingston Ave., no setback less than 55' from the curb is permissible, certainly not the proposed 40’-8” and even shorter proposed 31’-2.5". The setback for the proposed development on West Kingston Ave. must maintain and match the existing historic setback on the block — being relative to the homes that are oriented the same direction. "Relate the setback of any new construction and additions to the setback of the existing historic buildings in the immediate surroundings of the proposed new construction.” (Section 7.4 of the CHDDS). The single-family home immediately adjacent to the site at 421-423 West Kingston Ave. has a setback of 66'-0” from curb. The applicant’s referenced setback of 47'-0” for 415 West Kingston Ave. is not accurate, because it is not measured from the thermal wall; rather, the measurement wrongly includes the screened-in front porch. "Setback is the distance between the front thermal wall of the building and the property line or right-of-way boundary at the front of the lot.” (Section 6.5 of the CHDDS). - It is pertinent to note that each of the buildings referenced by the applicant for height context have large setbacks. This is because large setbacks assist in reducing height, width, massing, spacing, etc. 

5. ORIENTATION: No orientation of units facing the backyards of the interior properties at 421-423 West Kingston Ave. and 420 West Blvd. is permissible. All units must either face the streets (West Blvd., South Mint St., or West Kingston Ave.) or the proposed courtyard. "With courtyard type developments, the streetfront units should be oriented to the street, like existing houses in context, along with the courtyard oriented to the street with interior/rear unit entrances facing the courtyard.” (Section 6.7 of the CHDDS). 

6. LANDSCAPING: The applicant needs to provide more information on the proposed landscaping and fencing plans for the proposed development .

For example, will the mature trees next to 421-423 West Kingston Ave. remain? Thanks Sam Proposed

I have concerns about the number of units being added and how it will drastically change the historic feel and neighborhood of Wilmore. 

I would like to join the meeting on August 9th. My name is Sarah Sovchen, sarah.sovchen@gmail.com , 954-253-

6075, and I own 248 W Kingston Ave, Charlotte, NC 28203 and have comments on agenda item 16. 

The scale of the apartment is increasing the entire neighborhood occupancy by nearly 50%. Wilmore is a neighborhood of mostly single-family homes, all matching the historic character and bungalow style. This complex would completely undermine this standard. On West Kingston Ave., the MASSING AND SPACING of the proposed 

development needs to be broken down to fit the neighborhood context of the 1.5- and 2-story single-family homes on separate parcels (seven (7) to be specific). 

I also have major concerns about the number of cars routing down Kingston (a residential street) and parking on the street, especially with having a exit directly onto Kingston. How much parking will the site be providing? Will each unit have multiple parking spaces and ample visitor parking? After hearing from the developer, it sounds like the units are planned to be larger, meaning multiple cars per residence, and not enough parking to accommodate this. Multiple residents on Kingston have contacted the city to request traffic calming measures and have been denied due to recent spacing requirements. Kingston is already a street where cars speed and do not obey traffic laws, this complex will only add to that problem and accommodations need to be made if adding housing for 270+ residents. Will there be stop signs added to the exit AND to Kingston Ave? A stop sign or speedbump also needs to be added between S. Tryon and Southwood, where cars will pass when heading to S. Tryon. 

In addition to the comments above, the developer's ability to convert the proposed units to office is a massive concern. As noted above, this is a residential neighborhood and the ability to turn any of these units into office will drive traffic to the neighborhood and ruin the feel of the community. 

This updated proposal, including only 1 retail space, does not add to the neighborhood, rather, adding massive housing just deteriorates our neighborhood feel. This does not preserve the community area, it converts it to a profit maker by using the building for housing units. 

Thank you, 

Sarah Sovchen
