Hello, 

As a current resident of Wilmore, there are a couple concerns regarding the proposed redevelopment around the 

Wilmore School that I'd like to bring for consideration as we review the plans during the meeting tomorrow, 

9/13/23. 

1. The current design of the building is not sympath etic to the existing Wilmore School, the surrounding single 

family homes/duplexes, or the character of a historic district. Additionally, design aside, the number of proposed 

units is outside the current diverse, vibrant, existing neighborhood where the re sidents live in single family or 

duplex homes. Adding a structure with 200+ units significantly changes the community the current residents seek 

when they choose to live in the neighborhood. 

2. The current design of the building is not in line with the g uidelines of the HDC as they currently exceed the 

tallest historic buildings within 360 degree view of the proposed development. 

I certainly support the re -development of the Wilmore School to bring life back into a building that has long been a 

staple o f the neighborhood. However, we need to be thoughtful on any proposed designs to ensure the integrity 

and character of the neighborhood are maintained. A future project will not be successful if it does not 

complement the neighborhood so many love so it is in the best interest of both parties to ensure that the design 

and proposed plans are in line with the HDC guidelines. 

Thanks, 

Megan

Ms. Drath, 

My name is Justin Bell and I live at 1829 S. Mint St. My only (and big) concern is the parking situation that will become an issue for the surrounding neighborhood. I live one block from the corner of West Blvd and Mint St. which is the corner of the Wilmore School project. 

From the previous discussion held by the developers regarding the Wilmore School project, they will have roughly 1.3 spaces per unit plus 20 or so additional "first come, first serve" parking spots on the project site. So what happens if there are roommates and they both have vehicles. What happens to the visitors for all the units. And please note that the submitted plans don't actually tell how many units there are going to be. But let's assume there will be 500 for arguments sake. Let's also say 10% have visitors at any given time. That means there will have to be 50 extra spots. If the project only has 20 or so "first come, first served" spots (and don't forget about the Doordash deliveries taking up spots), then the neighborhood will have to absorb 30 additional parking spots. 

Again, this does not account for the multiple car units that will have their cars parked in the neighborhood. 

Nor does this account for the cars that will park for the ground floor retail shop at the corner of West Blvd and S. Mint St. Where are these people going to park when there is no parking allowed on either of these crossing streets? Will the city re-zone for parking tags for permanent residents? 

And sadly, with all these new parked cars in the neighborhood, there will be an uptick of litter since these people don't permanently live in the neighborhood and car-break-in's will increase since there is going to be a flood of cars parked on the neighborhood streets. 

I am not totally opposed to this project, but if they don't increase their parking garage capacity, I may have to be opposed to the project. But it appears that the developer wants to have their cake and eat it too while the existing HISTORIC neighborhood takes the brunt. I have not been happy with a previous decision by the Historic Board on an ADU that is essentially a second house on a corner lot because how the heck is that "historic", so I assume you all will again cave to the developer with no actual care about the surrounding neighborhood. Though I am curious how many Historic Board members live in the Wilmore neighborhood? I doubt there are any, but I ask that you think if this was going into your neighborhood a block from your home, you would have major concerns too. I am even more curious of how many large projects like this are going up within one block of Board Member's houses? 

Lastly, I do wish to attend this week's virtual meeting. Thank you for your time, 

Justin Bell

Subject: [EXT]Updated Comments & Evidence on HDCCMA-2023-00283 - Wilmore School 

Kristi and Marilyn, 

Below are my updated written comments and attached is updated evidence ( a new PDF ) on HDCCMA-

2023-00283 for the proposed development at the Wilmore School lot. For signing up to attend/speak via WebEx at the September 13th HDC meeting, my name is Samantha N. Skains-Menchaca (homeowner at 417 West Kingston Ave. adjacent to the Wilmore School), and my email address is snskains@gmail.com .

1. 

WILMORE NEIGHBORHOOD : As an initial matter, the proposed development is primarily for 270 multi-

family units (current zoned for 26 townhomes), the tallest portion being visually six (6) stories from each 

the curb on West Kingston Ave. and the curb on South Mint St. and the width being "approximately 75’ 

long on West Blvd, 360’ long on Mint St and 300’ long on Kingston Ave." The design of the proposed 

development is the very type of large, block-style apartment complex that significantly undermines the character of a historic district. As explicitly stated in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission’s Wilmore Small Area / Special Project Plan at http://ww.charmeck.org/Planning/Land%20Use%20Planning/Wilmore.pdf ("to be used as a general 

policy guide for land use decisions in the Wilmore neighborhood"), “the single family character of Wilmore [is] threatened by intensification and the encroachment of nonresidential uses”. Additionally, with respect to the existing Wilmore School building itself, new developments must “[l]imit the size of the addition so that it does not visually overpower the existing building.” (Sections 6.20 and 7.17 of the CHDDS). 

- There are about 550 lots in the Historic Wilmore, the sister neighborhood to Historic Dilworth, with the vast majority of the lots being 1.5- and 2-story single-family homes: "Wilmore mirrors the single-family Bungalows and wide curvilinear streets and sidewalks of Dilworth and shared the streetcar line from the 

center of town with this sister neighborhood.” (Section 3.7 of the CHDDS). Historic Wilmore is not at all 

akin to Historic Fourth Ward, where there are several multi-story buildings. There is not a single 

building in Historic Wilmore that is more than three (3) stories .

2. 

CONTEXT ON WEST KINGSTON AVE. : West Kingston Ave. between South Mint St. and South Tryon 

St. only has single-family homes with a few duplexes and fourplexes -- no apartment buildings, churches, 

or commercial buildings. In fact, the Wilmore School lot on West Kingston Ave. was historically seven (7) separate parcels, as evidenced by the 1929 Sanborn Insurance Map, Volume One, Page 46. "New multi-

family buildings should respect historic lot lines and parcel sizes. For multi-family buildings that are more 

than one lot width on the primary elevation and street, the mass of the building should be modulated with a material change and/or architectural change that creates a break in the wall plane to emulate the 

spacing of existing historic buildings.” (Section 6.6 of the CHDDS; See also Section 7.3 of the 

CHDDS). Additionally, “[m]ulti-family developments with more than four units will need to employ techniques for breaking down the mass and modulating the facades to appear as separate structures in order to have the new development fit the scale of the existing historic context.” (Section 6.8 of the 

CHDDS). Specifically on West Kingston Ave., the MASSING AND SPACING of the proposed 

development needs to be broken down to fit the neighborhood context of the 1.5- and 2-story single-

family homes on separate parcels (seven (7) to be specific). 

3. 

HEIGHT: Absolutely no height above 49’-6” from curb is permissible any where for the proposed 

development, certainly not the proposed 65’ feet from “average curb” (What exactly is “average 

curb”?). "The height of a proposed building should be no taller than the tallest historic building on the block within a 360-degree range of visibility of the same type. The height of the historic structure should be calculated from the original historic ridge line, not any later additions that may be taller.” (Section 7.8 of the CHDDS). From curb, the Wilmore School building is 42’-6”, while the Calvary United Methodist Church building is 43’-10”. The accompanying building to this Church (which is not actually visible from the Wilmore School lot) is 49’-6” from curb. If this building is nevertheless accepted within the 360-degree range, this is the tallest historic building, and certainly no building proposed on the Wilmore School lot is permitted to be taller than 49’-6” from curb. 

-

While the applicant alleges that “[t]he tallest 5 floor portion of the building (54-5’ above grade, max 65’ above average curb) will only be located at the center of the site and will have limited visibility 

from surrounding frontages”, this is not accurate. First, that tallest portion is actually 6 floors visually 

from the curb on each West Kingston Ave. and South Mint St. Second, the renderings provided by the applicant cherry-pick a select few angles at frontages where the proposed tallest portion may not be visible or only slightly visible. From the majority of angles (which are materially omitted by the applicant), the proposed tallest portion will be significantly visible, towering over adjacent 1.5 and 2-story single-family homes. The applicant needs to provide more renderings, at different sights/angles relative to the existing historic context (with height measurements), as well as with specific design details (window, doors, lighting, etc).

4. 

SETBACK: For the proposed development on West Kingston Ave., no setback less than 55' from the 

curb is permissible, certainly not the proposed 40’-8” and even shorter proposed 31’-2.5". The setback for the proposed development on West Kingston Ave. must maintain and match the existing historic setback on the block — being relative to the homes that are oriented the same direction. " Relate the setback of any new construction and additions to the setback of the existing historic buildings in the immediate surroundings of the proposed new construction.” (Section 7.4 of the CHDDS). The single-family home immediately adjacent to the site at 421-423 West Kingston Ave. has a setback of 66'-0” from curb. The applicant’s referenced setback of 47'-0” for 415 West Kingston Ave. is not accurate, because it is not measured from the thermal wall; rather, the measurement wrongly 

includes the screened-in front porch. " Setback is the distance between the front thermal wall of the building and the property line or right-of-way boundary at the front of the lot.” (Section 6.5 of the CHDDS). 

-

It is pertinent to note that each of the buildings referenced by the applicant for height context have large setbacks. This is because large setbacks assist in reducing height, width, massing, spacing, etc.

5. 

ORIENTATION: No orientation of units facing the backyards of the interior properties at 421-423 West 

Kingston Ave. and 420 West Blvd. is permissible. All units must either face the streets (West Blvd., South Mint St., or West Kingston Ave.) or the proposed courtyard. " With courtyard type developments, the streetfront units should be oriented to the street, like existing houses in context, along with the courtyard oriented to the street with interior/rear unit entrances facing the courtyard.” (Section 6.7 of the CHDDS). 

6. 

LANDSCAPING: The applicant needs to provide more information on the proposed landscaping and 

fencing plans for the proposed development . For example, will the mature trees next to 421-423 West Kingston Ave. remain?

# Development 

Not Historic 

Not Historic 1 - Wilmore Neighborhood 

Historic Wilmore is not at all akin to Historic Fourth Ward, 

where there are several multi -story buildings. There is not a 

single building in Historic Wilmore that is more than three 

(3) stories. Before expansion into a paved 

parking lot, the Wilmore School lot 

on West Kingston Ave. was 

historically seven (7) separate 

parcels. 

# 2 - Context on W. Kingston Ave. 

The massing and spacing of the 

proposed development needs to be

family homes on separate parcels 

(seven (7) to be specific). 3.1 - Height

Zoning Staff have already raised 

concern with proposed building 

height. 

Even before considering HDC 

guidelines for height context, the 

proposed building is already violating 

Zoning height restrictions (highlighted 

in red). The setback for the proposed 

development on West Kingston Ave. 

must maintain and match the existing 

historic setback on the block — being 

relative to the homes that are oriented 

the same direction.

# 4.1 - Setback 4.2 - Setback 

The applicant’s referenced setback of 47' -0” for 415 West Kingston Ave. is not accurate, because it is not 

measured from the thermal wall; rather, the measurement wrongly includes the screened -in front porch. 

"Setback is the distance between the front thermal wall of the building and the property line or right -of -way 

boundary at the front of the lot.” (Section 6.5 of the CHDDS). 4.3 - Setback 

It is pertinent to note that

Hi - This is related to HDCCMA -2023 -00283, 424 -428 West Boulevard (PID: 11907801). I am unable to attend the in 

person meeting on September 13 at 1:00 so wanted to share my thoughts via email. This is a note I shared with the 

rezoning planner, Joe Mangum, after attending a meeting the law office managing the rezoning efforts held. 

I'm Alex Moore and I live at 1726 S Mint St, Charlotte, NC 28203 in the Wilmore Historic District. I live here with my 

wife and 1 year old child. We bought our home in January 2020. 

We were recently made aware of the in -progress efforts to rezone the old Wilmore School through mail we 

received. After attending the information session that Alexander Ricks (attorney representing the to -be developer) 

held on 8/7 we became concerned with the ramifications this would have on the community and our family. 

The development plans call for 280 high density units and 1 -2 retail spaces. The proposed retail space is about 100 

feet from where our 1 year olds nursery is. The construction is planned to take 20 -24 months. The construction 

noise, along with ongoing noise that comes along with a retail space will almost certainly impact our baby 's ability 

to sleep. Along with this, I work permanently from home and am very concerned about how the constant 

construction noise for 2 years will affect my ability to do so. 

The development plans call for a new entrance on S Mint st for residents. West Blvd and S Mint are already 

extremely busy with car traffic. Our home is located on the intersection and it's very difficult to get out of our 

driveway. With the addition of the 280 high density units and the cars to come along with that, it's going to gre atly 

impact our ability to get in and out of our home. 

The concerns expressed up to this point are all personal but I do want to address the impacts this can have on the 

community as well. Wilmore is an area of single family homes, sprinkled with a few du plexes and quads. A 280 unit 

apartment complex with a parking garage, pool etc is going to change the whole feel of the community, especially 

considering this is the historic part of Wilmore . Families move here to get away from the noise of South End. 

Allo wing a rezoning into high -density apartments sets the stage for continued redevelopment of the area 

impacting all those who moved here to get away from that very thing. 

Thank you,

Please click the Phish Alert button to forward the email to Bad.Mail. Hi Kristi, I hope you are doing well and that you’ve had a nice summer. I wanted to provide feedback on the WIlmore School proposed plans. Unfortunately I am not able to call in (due with baby #2 any minute!!) but wanted to at least provide some feedback to be included. I first wanted to start with as a long time Wilmore resident, I am excited to see interest in revitalizing the Wilmore School. It has sat unoccupied for too long and is such an important piece of our neighborhood’s history. That being said, I don’t think that the proposed plans are the best for our community for a variety of reasons. Namely the main points below: 1. Massing: The proposed plans include 6 stories and over 250 units- this would be the largest property in the area and would not abide by the historic guidelines set forth both from an architectural standpoint and from a single family structure standpoint. There are no multi family units on the street. 2. Height: 6 stories from the Kingston street level is incredibly tall and would appear as a monstrosity in the neighborhood. Thanks!

I have concerns about the number of units being added and how it will drastically change the historic feel and neighborhood of Wilmore. 

I would like to join the meeting on August 9th. My name is Sarah Sovchen, sarah.sovchen@gmail.com , 954-253-

6075, and I own 248 W Kingston Ave, Charlotte, NC 28203 and have comments on agenda item 16. 

The scale of the apartment is increasing the entire neighborhood occupancy by nearly 50%. Wilmore is a neighborhood of mostly single-family homes, all matching the historic character and bungalow style. This complex would completely undermine this standard. On West Kingston Ave., the MASSING AND SPACING of the proposed 

development needs to be broken down to fit the neighborhood context of the 1.5- and 2-story single-family homes on separate parcels (seven (7) to be specific). 

I also have major concerns about the number of cars routing down Kingston (a residential street) and parking on the street, especially with having a exit directly onto Kingston. How much parking will the site be providing? Will each unit have multiple parking spaces and ample visitor parking? After hearing from the developer, it sounds like the units are planned to be larger, meaning multiple cars per residence, and not enough parking to accommodate this. Multiple residents on Kingston have contacted the city to request traffic calming measures and have been denied due to recent spacing requirements. Kingston is already a street where cars speed and do not obey traffic laws, this complex will only add to that problem and accommodations need to be made if adding housing for 270+ residents. Will there be stop signs added to the exit AND to Kingston Ave? A stop sign or speedbump also needs to be added between S. Tryon and Southwood, where cars will pass when heading to S. Tryon. 

In addition to the comments above, the developer's ability to convert the proposed units to office is a massive concern. As noted above, this is a residential neighborhood and the ability to turn any of these units into office will drive traffic to the neighborhood and ruin the feel of the community. 

This updated proposal, including only 1 retail space, does not add to the neighborhood, rather, adding massive housing just deteriorates our neighborhood feel. This does not preserve the community area, it converts it to a profit maker by using the building for housing units. 

Thank you,

Good afternoon and I hope you are doing well. I am writing to you once again on my opposition to the new 

construction project requested at 1921 Charlotte Drive. 

I ha ve lived across the street from this property since 1988 and have enjoyed looking at the beautiful oak trees on 

their property. These stately trees also shield the traffic on Kenilworth as well as hide my view of the condos. The 

proposed project would cu t down three large oak trees with the largest being 51 inches in circumference. It would 

take many decades to replace these trees that make our historic neighborhood outstanding. I highly encourage 

you to save these healthy beautiful trees. 

My other conc ern for this project is the size/mass of the project as it is out of character with our neighborhood. 

Unfortunately I am out of town for this meeting and do not have access to a phone/laptop. 

Thank you

Kristi and Maril yn, 

Our comments regarding Case # HDCCMA -2023 -00115 are as follows: 

For nearly twenty years we have lived and owned a house on Ideal Way that is two lots 

away from 1921 Charlotte Drive and are writing to express our strong opposition to the 

proposed ex pansion/project at this address. There are a number of concerns we have 

with the project: 

- This property in its current state (with architectural features very inconsistent with 

Historical Dilworth) is already a negative factor on the historical charm o f our 

neighborhood and adding to/expanding it will only increase this issue. 

- The current use of the property as a hotel has already caused a significant increase in 

car traffic and litter/trash in the neighborhood, increasing the structure for greater 

occupancy will only exacerbate these problems. 

- A small hotel in a non -historical building is already inconsistent with Historical Dilworth 

and the envisioned larger one would be even more inconsistent. 

- The current treescape at 1921 Charlotte Drive partially masks some of the issues with 

the current structure and the planned removal of some or all of these trees would further 

highlight this non -historical property. 

- In the twenty years we have been in Dilworth the runoff from rain has become a 

significant issue that at times overwhelms the drainage (with one of the frequent 

problem areas being at the intersection of Ideal Way and Charlotte Drive); further 

development on this property will increase this already thorny problem.

LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICT: Plaza Midwood 

PROPERTY ADDRESS: 1509 Belvedere Avenue 

SUMMARY OF REQUEST: Changes to Original House 

Corrections to the Details of Proposed Request 

I would like to point out and correct the information on the Proposal and in the Existing Conditions description as well. 

 Existing Conditions describe the house with two additions. Which is Not the case at all. The house has two gable roofs interlinked (the main-would be the living room and bedrooms and smaller one would be the kitchen) House has only One addition (to the master bedroom facing the backyard) 

Moving to the proposal: 

 Section 5 reads: “Replace all non-original, 1/1 vinyl double-hung windows with new 1/1 vinyl double-hung windows. ”

That is Not the case and we do Not propose replacement of all windows. Only two windows are proposed for replacement (one of which had a broken glass and the second one was inoperable and could not be fixed) see pictures in my presentation. RightElevation

I strongly oppose the plan at 1509 Belvedere. This man came in and had people tearing off asbestos siding with ZERO protection exposing them (and my son and I who live next door) to asbestos. It was not taken off properly. It was cracked etc. His submission does not even show our house as being the one next to his. Also, he has let the house sit with rotting wood, weeds overtaking the backyard, animals running around, etc. I strongly hope his plan is denied and/or that his removal of the remaining asbestos siding is painstakingly monitored. 

Thanks, --Anna Louise Verderame, Esq. (703)303-6386-cell
