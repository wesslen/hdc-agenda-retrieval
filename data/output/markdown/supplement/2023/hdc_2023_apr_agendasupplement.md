RE: Inspection of windows and front door – 1512 Southwood Ave. 

Using the attached drawings and pictures of the 13 windows and doors as a guide, I visited the 

property at 1512 Southwood to perform an inspection. 

These are called louvered windows, which use what we call jalousie operators to open and close. 

Very common to the 50s. My guess is that they are original windows. The single glass door (#1) is 

not from the 50’s and is much newer. The door fr ame is installed incorrectly in the brick opening 

and both the door and its frame are broken which will require removal, and replacement with a new 

door and frame. 

The current tenant has been in the building for 10 years and reported that after several br eak ins, he 

had to screw the ground floor window on Southwood (#2) closed with screws through the frame of 

the window. The tenant also installed a thick metal screening on the inside to stop burglars from 

pushing the louvered window open to gain access th e screws penetrated through the window frame. 

The window frame and assembly is completely ruined. 

The windows are extremely energy inefficient and because they are not thermally broken in this 

climate sweat/condensate causing rot and mold that is a probl em. The thin aluminum frames of the 

windows are broken throughout the building and almost all have been rendered in -operable. We 

have never attempted repair of these type windows as the aluminum is typically un -repairable. Also, 

the existing windows are n ot properly installed in the openings and a commercial window frame 

assembly would provide a proper fit. It would be my recommendation to replace the windows with 

updated commercial rated openings. With applied muttons it would be easy to match similar cur b

appearance with a commercial window that is appropriate for the type of window openings in the 

masonry exterior walls.

Mobile: 704 -201 -9523 February 23, 2023 To Whom it may Concern, We reviewed the current windows at 1512 Southwood Avenue as shown on the attached schedule with images as to their structural integrity. The windows would need to be restored to be viable to remain however, that can’t be done. Unfortunately, the hardware is obsolete, and the owner Ron Skufca would need to locate a machinist to create custom parts and pieces for the hand cranks. The thin aluminum channeling is compromised in all windows observed and is also no longer produced. He would have to have the replacement hand fabricated, and would still not be a direct match to the existing windows. Sorry for the disappointing news. Warm Regards

1512 Southwood Additional Window Photos Opening 2: 

Exterior frame showing aluminum fatigue and self-taping screws installed through thermal envelope. Interior: Self-taping screws used to affix mesh drilled directly into frame breaking the thermal envelope. 122-B west bland st. charlotte, nc 28203 

Opening 3: 

Frame damage on left photo shows an already failed patch attempt with an additional piece of metal affixed at the top screw. Right photo shows the completely dismantled opening control device for this window, the frame also shows signs of aluminum corrosion and fatigue. 

Opening 6: 

Frame opening mechanism is non function and out of alignment with the frame, frame shows damage on sides. Vine growth has lodged into certain sections of the frame/building. 122-B west bland st. charlotte, nc 28203 

Opening 7: 

Window frame shows aluminum fatigue as well as has multiple cracks that have previously attempted repairs. Previous repairs include an applied material over the damage. 

Opening 8: 

Opening mechanism is broken and bent out of alignment with the frame. Frame shows damage around the edges as well as aluminum corrosion from remaining permanently open. 122-B west bland st. charlotte, nc 28203 

Opening 9: 

Opening mechanism is non-functional, frame/lower window pane has warped from original location. Window does not sit properly in opening. On the right you can see the frame is bowed inward as well as where the frame does not sit properly and outside light is visible. 

Opening 11: 

Vines have grown through/around the frame damaging the frame itself as well as the operating mechanism. 122-B west bland st. charlotte, nc 28203 

Opening 12: 

Window does not fit in the opening, aluminum bar located beneath the window to raise it. Several large holes are seen between the frame and the opening as the window does not fit correctly. The aluminumhas suffered fatigue and since the original submission the mechanism has completely failed. Frame shows signs of aluminum fatigue as well as stress cracking all along the frame, the sections are showing signs of separation. 122-B west bland st. charlotte, nc 28203 

Opening 13: 

Window does not fit in the opening correctly, several layers of caulk used to close openings, frame is bent around opening mechanism and is permanently jammed open. Window frame is separating between the assembled sections. The caulk joint is just shy of ¾” as the window does not fit properly. 2. 1512 Thomas Av (PID: 08118722) HDCRMl-2023-00254 Plaza Midwood Bill Hughes, Applicant 1' - 3"

e. Downspouts should be relocated to the side (not front) of the new porch column. -

Will do. Supplemental 

2. Accessory building changes: a. What is the entry door material? Provide a cut sheet and specification for the new door. - See cut sheet. Material to be Fir, painted while to match existing trim. 

b. Window trim dimensions needed. The window mullion needs to be wider than the exterior trim. c. Window spec sheets call for a “FactoryMull”, which has not been approved by the Commission because mullion design and dimensions will be too narrow. -

Window surrounding trim will be 5 ¾ wide and center mullion will be 7” wide, both to match existing home (pictured) 

5 ¾ “ wide 7“ wide Are there other examples of asymmetrical porch roofs supported by in Dilworth?

## 300 block of Kingston Applicant Responses to Staff Comments 

Uploaded on April 11, 2023 

1. Front porch 

a. What are the footprint dimensions of the front porch? 

Applicant Response: The footprint dimensions of the front porch are 10 feet deep by 21 feet 

wide by 2 feet tall. 

b. How will the new front porch impact the front chimney? 

Applicant Response: The new front porch will not touch the front chimney or impact it in any 

way. No changes are being proposed to the front chimney which will still provide a strong contributing element to the character of the historic home. 

c. Trellis columns need additional cap and base details. 

Applicant Response: Applicant modeled the columns on the columns on the pergola located at 

1015 East Blvd. which was previously approved by the historic district commission(see case number HDC2018-496) . A description and photos of such pergola are shown on page 13 of the presentation provided to staff in advance of the meeting. The column will have no cap trim. The column will have base trim that is 12 inch tall made of wood, painted white, that will wrap the bottom of the column (starting at the bottom of the column reaching up 12 inches). 

d. Provide a photo of the proposed quarry tile floor. 

Applicant Response: The proposed quarry tile floor will match the existing quarry tile floor at 

the top of the stairs at the front entrance to the home. The quarry tiles are red in color, 4”x4” square, and separated by grout lines about 5/8” wide. A photo of such tile floor is below. 

e. Will the trellis attach to the building or just the new front porch? 

Applicant Response: The trellis will not attach to the building, just to the new front porch. 2. Side Porch Changes 

a. Front elevation, door design appears incongruous with the 6/6 design of the original fenestration. 

Applicant Response: The original fenestration was a screened in porch that did not contain any 

6/6 windows. The old photos of the home that applicants submitted as part of the application show that the original fenestration was comprised of screens that filled the openings in the brick walls at the front and side and rear elevations of the screened in porch. To applicant’s knowledge, there were never any 6/6 windows in this location of the house, so that was not the original fenestration. The full panel glass door design is not incongruous with the style of the home. Instead, it more closely reflects the original style of the home which contained full screens in the brick openings at the front and side elevations. 

b. Right elevation fenestration and trim design. 

Applicant Response: The right elevation fenestration will consist of 4 wooden, metal-clad full 

panel glass doors that are fixed in place. The trim design of the trim surrounding such fenestration will be white wood trim to match the existing style, period and theme of the wood trim that surrounds the existing window openings, in accordance with the Historic District Guidelines for Rehabilitation of Building Elements, Section 4.11 (Trim). Below are pictures of such wood trim. 

c. On the rear elevation, will the steps be enlarged? Is a handrail needed? 

Applicant Response: No changes will be made to the existing rear elevation steps. The steps 

will not be enlarged and a handrail is not needed. A handrail does not currently exist and to applicant’s knowledge has never existed. d. Proposed fenestration is metal clad. 

Applicant Response: The proposed fenestration are wooden doors that are clad in metal with 

full glass panels. According to the Historic District Guidelines for Rehabilitation of Building Elements, Guidelines for Replacement Windows states that “aluminum clad wood that meet these guidelines may be considered on a case by case basis.” See Historic District Guidelines for Rehabilitation of Building Elements, For Replacement Windows, Section 4.14, Guideline #19. 

e. Trim details needed. 

Applicant Response: The trim around each of the openings on the front, right and rear 

elevations will be wood painted white to match the existing style, period and theme of the wood trim that surrounds the existing window openings, in accordance with the Historic District Guidelines for Rehabilitation of Building Elements, Section 4.11 (Trim). See pictures above in response to Question 2b. Neighboring Brick Home Examples

My name is Russell Ruckterstuhl and I have been a resident of Dilworth for 29 years. Proposed project HDCCMA-2023-00115 is within sight of my home on East Worthington Ave. I am against approval of this new construction / addition proposal for the following reasons: (page of Historic District Design Standard for reference) 1. Massing and Complexity of Form (7.7) The subject project does not adequately address massing and complexity of form to fit in with the adjacent historic buildings. The east and west elevations of the new building are simple, flat surfaces without any complexity. The east elevation along Kenilworth is also flat with minimal rhythm provided by a change in exterior finish. None of the massing mimics any of the form from adjacent historic buildings with projecting bays, dormers, etc. The building is nothing more than a simple, plain box you would expect from a suburban motel. 2. Scale (7.9) The subject project does not include any design elements that provide a human scale for the building . The building should include elements typical to the surrounding context such as porches or one story projections to bring the building into scale with the surrounding neighborhood. None of these elements are included in the current design. 3. Orientation (7.6) This proposal does not orient the entrance to the street. The existing building does not have and entrance from Charlotte drive. The applicant incorrectly states that there is a “recessed off-center entry on Charlotte Drive” - this access has been removed. The main hotel entrance is directly from the parking lot on the side of the building and it not accessible by pedestrians from Charlotte Drive. This is important since the property is planning to utilize on-street parking. 4. Spacing (7.5) The subject project does not provide spacing between the existing and new structure along Ideal way that matches the historic pattern in the immediate surroundings of the new construction. There is approximately 10’ between the new and existing buildings - much less than between other buildings in the immediate area. This adds to the massing and scale of the project from Ideal Way making the building spacing unlike the surrounding historic properties. 5. Lighting (8.12) The subject project existing parking lot includes a sodium pole light and single light over the parking lot building entrance. The building along Charlotte Drive and Ideal Way is dark without any exterior lights. The subject project does not address lighting in their documentation. The design standards sate that new listing should be dark sky compliant, downward directed, and fully shielded. Also, bright security lighting mounted at eve heights of buildings should be avoided and any security lighting must be downward directed. 6. Parking (8.3) The subject project has the parking lot in the side yard is prominent when approaching the property from the north on Charlotte drive. There is no screening provided to the north of the parking lot and the screening of the parking lot from Charlotte drive is limited at ground level. In general, please note that the existing building is a commercial building less than 50 years old. The existing building can not 

be considered as “context” for new construction per page 3.29. The same goes for the three condominium buildings to the north on Charlotte Drive. Just because the existing building and surrounding non-historic buildings do not meet the historic district standards it does not mean that this building expansion is exempt from their requirements. When compared to the historic structures surrounding the property, this proposed design is not up to these standards. In addition to these design issues there are other issues with this project such as the removal of mature trees and the increase in non-permeable area. Due to all of these issues with the proposed project, please consider voting “against” this proposal. Thank you, Russell Ruckterstuhl 1227 E.

A ttention: Marilyn Drath and the City of Charlotte Historic District Commission: 

I’m writing today, as a Charlotte Drive neighbor, to voice my opposition to the proposed expansion of the building on PID: 12111901 located at 1921 Charlotte Drive. As a fellow steward of historic Dilworth, I wanted to provide input. I’m unable to attend Wednesday’s (4/12/23) HDC meeting, but have a vested interest in balancing progress while respecting and maintaining historic standards. 

The proposed design lacks many of the core elements and details that have helped to preserve the historic charm that characterizes the Dilworth neighborhood. 

1. First, the proposed design does not take into consideration the preservation of green space, nor does it respect the neighborhood’s (and city’s) mission to maintain a large tree canopy. a. The proposed building addition and 6 new parking spaces increase the impervious surface area on the lot. b. The proposed structure would require the removal of 3 mature trees on Dilworth’s historic edge. If we don’t maintain historic standards in preserving the edges of the historic district, it will continue to shrink. 2. The density created by the proposed addition, by comparison, is incongruent with other single family homes on Charlotte Drive and adjacent streets, and is not complementary to the streetscape. a. The size of two large structures on the property erodes the pedestrian feel and scale that exists throughout the neighborhood. 

b. When transitioning from single family to denser development, the historic context surrounding the site must be respected (height, massing, roof forms, materials, etc.) 3. Lastly, the proposed design package lacks a site dimensioning plan, making it difficult to know, specifically, the size and scale of what is being proposed. 

I’m grateful for your consideration and partnership in preservation.

Attention: Marilyn Drath and the City of Charlotte Historic District Commission: 

I’m writing today, as a Charlotte Drive neighbor, to voice my opposition to the proposed expansion of the building on PID: 12111901 located at 1921 Charlotte Drive. As a fellow steward of historic Dilworth, I wanted to provide input. I’m unable to attend Wednesday’s (4/12/23) HDC meeting, but have a vested interest in balancing progress while respecting and maintaining historic standards. 

The proposed design lacks many of the core elements and details that have helped to preserve the historic charm that characterizes the Dilworth neighborhood. 

1. First, the proposed design does not take into consideration the preservation of green space, nor does it respect the neighborhood’s (and city’s) mission to maintain a large tree canopy. a. The proposed building addition and 6 new parking spaces increase the impervious surface area on the lot. b. The proposed structure would require the removal of 3 mature trees on Dilworth’s historic edge. If we don’t maintain historic standards in preserving the edges of the historic district, it will continue to shrink. 2. The density created by the proposed addition, by comparison, is incongruent with other single family homes on Charlotte Drive and adjacent streets, and is not complementary to the streetscape. a. The size of two large structures on the property erodes the pedestrian feel and scale that exists throughout the neighborhood. 

b. When transitioning from single family to denser development, the historic context surrounding the site must be respected (height, massing, roof forms, materials, etc.) 3. Lastly, the proposed design package lacks a site dimensioning plan, making it difficult to know, specifically, the size and scale of what is being proposed. 

I’m grateful for your consideration and partnership in preservation.

Hello, my name is Scott Cottrill and I live at 1219 East Worthington Ave in Dilworth, very close in proximity to the proposed location where an expansion is proposed to an existing micro-hotel. 

First, safety is my #1 consideration. We enjoy living in an area where neighbors are actually friendly and our children feel safe. 

The existing location was originally built as a “half-way house” with very limited rooms, approximately 8. Later, it became a business and renting rooms by the night, approximately 17. The new proposed expansion will allow 33 rentals per night. 

This by no means should be approved and without doubt does not make sense to allow in a historic neighborhood. If approved, why not allow corporations to buy homes, demolish, and later construct 2, 5 or even 10 story complexes for businesses. Our neighborhood and children do not need more transient people that could lead to crime and go against the values of a historic district. We are not only speaking out aesthetics of the buildings, we are talking about the residents and their well being. 

Also it appears the building owners propose to cut down at least 3 large oak trees. I thought we were in favor of keeping our beautiful trees. This type of business goes against our density and mass guidelines. And lastly, we have yet to see exact dimensions of the proposed construction which is important as a community member to fully understand, even for consideration. 

With all due respect, I would ask that the proposed project NOT BE APPROVED. I understand this is a tough job for you all, but please help our community be safe and remain a “neighborhood.” Sincerely, Scott M. Cottrill

Hi Kristi and Marilyn, I was unsure of whom to send my comments regarding Case # HDCCMA-2023-00115 / 1921 Charlotte Dr, so I am sending to both of you. Please note that I am also trying to clear my schedule on Wednesday afternoon so that I may attend the HDC hearing in person to speak against approval of this project...I will email Marilyn before 10am on Wednesday to pre-register for the hearing, either in person or via WebEx. My comments regarding Case # HDCCMA-2023-00115 are as follows: As a property owner within 300 feet of 1921 Charlotte Dr, I strongly oppose approval of the proposed project for multiple reasons. First, the existing structure is already incongruent with the neighborhood, and is surrounded by mostly single-family homes that are contributing structures to the historic district; adding another incongruent structure on this property would only compound and highlight the inconsistency. Secondly, doubling the capacity of this hotel in our residential neighborhood would drastically impact the population density in this area (again, which is mostly comprised of many single-family homes). Thirdly, the proposed loss of mature trees to accommodate the project would negatively affect the tree canopy of the neighborhood. And, finally and most importantly, the ratio of non-permeable surfaces to permeable surfaces in the proposed plan does not appear to be appropriate or consistent with the standards that are imposed on the adjacent properties. 

Note: my home (which I am currently in the process of renovating, adhering to plans that were approved by the HDC in November 2021) is directly across the street from the proposed project at 1921 Charlotte Dr. Thank you in advance for considering my concerns.

Please click the Phish Alert button to forward the email to Bad.Mail. Kristina-We are the residents of 1238 E Worthington Avenue; therefore our backyard is immediately adjacent the subject property. We respectfully oppose the proposed addition on several grounds: - the existing structure is already completely out of character and scale with the adjacent 1-1.5 story residential structures. The mass of the current structure is mitigated somewhat by the offset from existing property lines and the lawn/trees between the property boundaries and the building. - the aforementioned mitigating elements would be destroyed by the proposed addition, and the mass (ie scale) and post-modern visual incongruity would be greatly exacerbated by the expansion. - the building already rests at a low point for storm water migration through the neighborhood, the loss of permeable land will likely deteriorate the already flood-prone geography.

Dear Kristi and Charlotte Historic District committee, As a resident of the Dilworth neighborhood and an adjacent neighbor, I’m writing about the 1921 Charlotte Drive proposal to add a second structure to the Kasa Edison Hotel site at the corner of Charlotte Drive and Ideal Way. This structure was built in 1992 and operated by Hope Haven as a halfway house with a capacity of 9 residents. This facility was a well received and peaceful addition to our neighborhood. The same structure is being currently utilized to house 17 people with the proposed structure to add an additional 16 people for a total of 33 people on a site that originally operated with less than a third of that amount. The building size and design elements do not fit with the human scale of the surrounding historic structures. This proposed project includes removal of three mature trees, one willow oak and two pecan trees. Our tree canopy is losing ground to constant development, as much as we can maintain our tree canopy without cutting down healthy trees, we will preserve a healthier space for the humans that reside and work in our community. The property at 1921 Charlotte Drive has a parking lot made of asphalt, the current structure and the addition of the proposed structure would almost double the footprint on this property. The addition of this second structure would lessen the permeability of this property, lessen the ability of rainwater to be absorbed on this site and increase the potential for runoff and flooding in the surrounding area. Please carefully consider this opportunity to protect this boundary property and maintain the integrity of our community. Heather Ruckterstuhl 1227 E.

Regarding the April 12, 2023 meeting of the HDC addressing the expansion of the motel at 1921 Charlotte Drive: as a resident living adjacent to the property I am dismayed at the possibility of the expansion passing. What was previously a halfway house for 9 residents (approved and welcome by the neighborhood in 1992) has grown and changed to a motel with a 17 rooms. Now the owners have petitioned the HDC to allow an additional building to be added that would expand the property to 33 rooms. This expansion would not only supersede the city permeability requirements by adding a new building and expanding the parking lot by 6 spaces, it would require the removal of THREE LARGE MATURE OAK TREES. Please consider the impact of the increased density on the neighborhood as well as the 2 other issues noted above. Thank You. Rachel Hewitt Information Submitted by the Public

Hello Kristina and Marilyn, 

We are reaching out regarding Case # HDCCMA-2023-00115 / 1921 Charlotte Drive. 

As a property owners three houses from 1921 Charlotte Dr, we strongly oppose approval of the proposed project for several reasons: The existing structure is already incongruent with the neighborhood and is surrounded by mostly single-family homes that are contributing structures to the historic district; adding another incongruent structure on this property would only compound and highlight the inconsistency. Doubling the capacity of this hotel in our residential neighborhood would drastically impact the population density in this area (again, which is mostly comprised of many single-family homes). 

The proposed loss of mature trees to accommodate the project would negatively affect the tree canopy of the neighborhood. 

Importantly, the ratio of non-permeable surfaces to permeable surfaces in the proposed plan does not appear to be appropriate or consistent with the standards that are imposed on the adjacent properties. Unfortunately, the current ownership does not do a good job keeping the property tidy….trash and yard debris are not maintained on a regular basis. We are concerned about street parking in an already congested area if these plans were approved. 

Kay plans to attend either via WebEx on in person. 

Thank you for accepting our input on this matter.

Hi Kristi, 

I am writing to express my thoughts regarding the above-referenced case. My comments are as follows: As a property owner within 400 feet of 1921 Charlotte Dr, I strongly oppose the approval of the proposed project for multiple reasons.

Good Evening Kristi, I am writing in regards to the hearing that is taking place on April 12, 2023 regarding 

HDCCMA-2023-00115 for the property located at 1921 Charlotte Drive. I am against the agenda item as it does not meet the historical district standards and adds a new type of building to the area that doesn't match other buildings (residential and non-residential in the area). 

First off, the massing and complexity of the new construction doesn't match existing adjacent historic buildings, as noted in section 7.7 of the historic standards. This would introduce a new building with complex massing. Secondly, the removal of 3 large mature trees is concerning as it would remove a portion of the lush garden-like atmosphere that is in much of the historic Dilworth district. These large trees help play a role in energy conservation on the property and the surrounding areas. These large trees that would be removed would rid the area of the historic trees that help define the area. The replacement of these trees in other areas of the property would take 20-40 years to get to the mature age and height of the current trees. The tree removal would continue to hurt the mature population that we continue to lose every year due to various reasons. Last, this new building would appear to go against the 50% impermeable material in the rear yard. 

Thank you for your consideration of these facts and I look forward to the result of the hearing. --
