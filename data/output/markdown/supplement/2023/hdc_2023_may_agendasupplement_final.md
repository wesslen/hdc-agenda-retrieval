# HDC Meeting 

# Applicant Submitted Information Information Submitted by the Public The following are written responses to each March continuation letter item: 1. Roof forms and materials, per Standard 6.13, numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The entire roof form has been significantly changed. The main context is shown on sheets CTX-003 and CTX-004. 2. Massing, Standard 6.8, number 6. 3. Height and Width, Standard 6.9, number 5. See sheet HDC-004 for evidence that our multi-family home respects the height and width in our context. Our home isn't the tallest or widest on our same blocks compared to single family historic homes and our home is less than the average of our relevant context. 4. Scale, Standard 6.10, number 4. 5. Provide the final plans, roof plans and elevations for the Commission to be able to assess these plans. Restudy especially a third floor, especially with regard to the impact of the pool and properly be able to assess the roof forms and massing, especially along West 8th Street. All roof forms have been significantly revised as a result of this re-study, which includes a full re-working of the 3rd floor. 6. Expand search for comparable buildings and appropriate context. Sheet HDC-003 has been entirely re-made. Context area has been expanded to reflect the standards. Additional historic, multi-family, and homes with a history of multi-family use have been noted as identified. 7. Consider a deeper front porch to help with the massing of the structure. After reviewing the porch form, we've decided to expand it as a wrap-around porch over the first floor. 8. Left elevation, explore the Directional Expression along West 8th Street to lower the impact along that street. The new roof forms add verticality to the elevation. There are also examples of horizontal directional expressions at 314 W 8th St, 412 N Poplar St, the side of 428 N Poplar St, the side of 529 N Poplar St, and the side of 601 N Poplar St in addition to the markup elevations shown in the last meeting's supplemental PDFs. 9. The Commission has not reviewed the rest of the building elements at this time (such as materials and cornices and trim). This submission is only requesting approval for the building envelope, solar roof, and electrochromic glazing so that the design engineering may continue towards completion. Please see the following supplemental PDF page for a summary of this item. Please see the following supplemental PDF page for a summary of this item. 2.  Massing, Standard 6.8, number 6. 4.  Scale, Standard 6.10, number 4. SCALE REDUCING TECHNIQUES SUMMARY Site doesn't adjoin historic dwellings, but we've incorporated various scale-reducing techniques regardless. Elevation steps forward and back in ~10 locations to break up the 8th St mass in smaller bays, which creates varying building planes. Tallest gable is set back the furthest at ~18' 6" even though it's used as an architectural feature. Multiple roofing materials proposed to break up the turret roof mass appearance. Materials used to break up the wall massing for scale. Porch roof used to break up the elevation massing. Porch roof used to break up the elevation massing. Numerous cues were taken from nearby historic buildings, see context sheets for numerous examples. Exterior fenestration and rhythm lined up neat and orderly on the exterior despite interior layout differences 3rd story ridge set back where it's barely visible from across the street. 3rd story ridge set back where it's barely visible from across the street. Cues taken from other historic homes: slightly varying ridge height, inverted V gables, Italianate cornice, turret, gable over bumpout. Cues taken from other historic homes, gable over porch roof with flatter roof portions to the side. 14' Setback at the bumpout is much larger of a setback than other similar height homes, this reduces the impact. This is a much larger setback than a number of other historic homes with tall eves and ridges. Multiple roofing materials proposed to break up the turret roof mass appearance. Fenestration at front orderly and similar to other historic homes. 3rd story built-in as a 2.5 story along with taller portions being setback to be less visible. Materials used to break up the mass. View last 8 seconds of video for completed roof example. Solar Roof Material Example Images 2nd Video link in the image above. #1. Our roof now uses numerous large gable and hipped roofs similar to various historic homes. A few examples are 320 W 9th St and 428 N Poplar St. #2. Our roof employs dormers similar to other historic homes. #3. Hip roof pitch, gable pitches, and turret pitch are similar to numerous historic homes. (Low slope less visible roof areas also have a few context examples on CTX-004 in the upper left.) #4. New roof fits within the style of a queen anne victorian and doesn't proportionally overwhelm the structure. #5. Eve design materials and Italianate styling are consistent with numerous homes including those on N Poplar St. #6. Slate style turret roof will best match the 4th ward context. #6-#7. Tesla solar roofing material is similar to a metal roof and with an appearance similar to slate roofs. The solar component is in itself less visible as I can't seem to tell which tiles have it and which don't. #8. The main roof ridge is lower, which reduces the scale and the 2.5 story upper roof ridge is built in except for the recessed bumpout gable, which also reduces the scale compared to other historic homes. #3. The massing of our home is modeled after single family homes, though it is multi-family. #1. Overall massing is modeled after other Queen Anne homes with angled walls and projecting bays. #2. A variety of projecting bays, dormers, turrets, gables, etc. have been incorporated into the design. #4. Though this standard is N/A. We've decided to incorporate numerous facade step backs and bumpouts, which is more than many other historic homes. #5. Complexity of form and materials break down the mass. #6. Though this standard is N/A. We've decided to set back the taller portions of the building and build in the 3rd floor as a 2.5 story to respect the neighboring non-historic home. Rough ridge line. Gable roof is similar to 601 N Poplar gable, yet in a different position of the elevation. Rough eve line, significantly less than 601 N Poplar St. Due to angle and scaling limitations, our home here is shown larger than it would appear in reality. Setback of our home is nearly double. ADDITIONAL WINDOW FENESTRATION CONTEXT The exterior layer of the glass can be kept translucent or the clear version of low-e glass, similar to how for the bathrooms we may be able to have a privacy glass on the inside, we can keep the electrochromic glazing on the inside of the double or triple pane windows. None of the privacy or electrochromic panes of glass would be directly visible on the exterior elevations. Thus, this electrochromic aspect would be similar to an interior automatic shade or electrically switchable film that is a part of the interior design of the home and in the interior private realm.

Re: 1706 Dilworth Rd E Property: 12311111 Case: HDCRMI -2022-01154 

Hello, My name is Sharon Frazier. I have owned and lived in the house at 1712 Dilworth Rd East since 1977. I am the closest neighbor and share a driveway with 1706 Dilworth Rd East. I am in total support of the proposal to change the material on the side porch to glass. At some point in the late 50’s or early 60’s the side porch on the house was boarded up to enclose it. This part of the house is out of character with the rest of the house and with Dilworth. The proposed change will take out the wooden boards and replace them with glass. This is much more in character with the original style of the house when this area was a screened-in porch. 

I am so impressed with the care and attention to detail the owners have taken in restoring and revitalizing the house at 1706 Dilworth Rd East. They are dedicated to retaining the character and quality of materials of this historic home. 

I heartily support this proposal.
