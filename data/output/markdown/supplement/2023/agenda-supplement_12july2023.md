> Dilworth Community Association

The Dilworth Historic District comprises roughly 70% of the Dilworth neighborhood as a whole and the 

edges of the district have been adversely affected for decades, mostly due to development and growth 

of our city. One of our objectives as the Dilworth Community Association is to preserve the historic 

designation of Dilworth and encourage intelligent, sustainable development that meets the HDC Design 

Standards. You commissioners and the HDC staff would not be here today if you didn’t share that 

passion for preservation. It is highly unusual for the DCA to speak against a project but we find this 

proposed project to be counter to our objective to preserve the historic designation of Dilworth. 

The DCA is opposing application HDCCMA-2023-00115 for 1921 Charlotte Drive for the following 

reasons: 

Context – the overall relationship of the project to its surroundings 

The parcel is surrounded by a mixture of Bungalows and American Small Houses on the north and east 

side. The other three commercial buildings on Charlotte Dr. to the north are less than 50 years old and 

would not be considered as context for new construction in the historic districts. The scale and massing 

of the proposed building creates an inappropriate relationship to the surrounding historic buildings and 

therefore does not meet the HDC standard requirement for context. 

Massing and Complexity of Form – the relationship of the buildings various parts to each other 

The massing of this building combined with the existing building cannot be found in any other historic 

property in Dilworth. There is virtually no spacing between the existing building and the proposed new 

building, giving the impression of a massive rectangle from the north, east and south side of the parcel. 

Per the renderings, the building has virtually no articulation on the east side along Kenilworth nor the 

south side along Ideal Way. It consumes almost the entire remaining open space as a very large 

rectangle after the proposed removal of heritage trees. There are no similar large boxes in the area’s 

nearby historic houses, consequently this building’s massing does not meet the HDC standard 

requirement for massing. 

Scale – the relationship of the building to those around it 

The historic buildings around this project are a mixture of Bungalows and American Small Houses dating 

back to the 1920s. Elements such as cornices, trim, porches, doors, and windows have not been used 

according to the renderings to create scale typical of the historic context and compatible with the 

historic buildings to the south and east of the parcel. This building does not meet the requirements for 

the criteria of scale. 

Lastly, a very serious concern with this project after the HDC review are the zoning issues that will present 

themselves if significant changes are not made to this plan. A few examples are that new construction of 

a hotel building is not an allowed use in this zoning district, and the parking proposed does not meet the 

required minimum. Realizing that zoning issues are outside of the HDC’s purview we will not discuss those 

at this point in time. Information Submitted by the Public

Dear Kristi and Charlotte Historic District committee, As a resident of the Dilworth neighborhood and an adjacent neighbor, I’m writing about the 1921 Charlotte Drive proposal to add a second structure to the Kasa Edison Hotel site at the corner of Charlotte Drive and Ideal Way. This structure was built in 1992 and operated by Hope Haven as a sobriety house with a capacity of 9 residents. This facility was a well received and peaceful addition to our neighborhood. The same structure is being currently utilized to house 17 people with the proposed structure to add an additional 16 people for a total of 33 people on a site that originally operated with less than a third of that amount. The building size and design elements do not fit with the human scale of the surrounding historic structures. This proposed project includes removal of three mature trees, one willow oak and two pecan trees. Our tree canopy is losing ground to constant development, as much as we can maintain our tree canopy without cutting down healthy trees, we will preserve a healthier space for the humans that reside and work in our community. The property at 1921 Charlotte Drive has a parking lot made of asphalt, the current structure and the addition of the proposed structure would almost double the footprint on this property. The addition of this second structure would lessen the permeability of this property, lessen the ability of rainwater to be absorbed on this site and increase the potential for runoff and flooding in the surrounding area. Please carefully consider this opportunity to protect this boundary property and maintain the integrity of our community. Heather Ruckterstuhl 1227 E. Worthington Ave. Revisions:
