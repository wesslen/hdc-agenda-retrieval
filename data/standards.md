INTRODUCTION 

Charlotte is a dynamic city that is on the move and is one of the key urban centers of 

the entire country. It has seen tremendous growth in recent decades and continues 

to enjoy rapid expansion and population increases. The city, with all its major 

employment sectors coupled with strong civic traditions, is a great place to live and 

has a very high quality of life. 

Within that existing context, Charlotte also has an interesting mix of neighborhoods, 

some of which are older and surround the central business district. These residential 

areas date largely from the early twentieth century and many have rich collections of 

historic buildings with various architectural styles, street patterns, open spaces, and 

landscaping. These areas have become more treasured as they survive subsequent 

generations of development. Charlotte wisely has decided to designate some of 

these neighborhoods as Local Historic Districts to celebrate this uniqueness and to 

offer additional regulatory protection for their preservation. 

In that regard, the Charlotte City Council adopted a Historic District Ordinance in 

1976 that creates the Charlotte Historic District Commission (HDC) to administer 

changes within these Local Historic Districts. The purpose of this ordinance is: 

“to encourage the restoration, preservation, rehabilitation, and 

conservation of historically significant areas, structures, buildings, sites, 

and objects and their surroundings from potentially adverse influences 

which may cause the decline, decay, or total destruction of important 

historical, architectural, and archaeological features, which are a part 

of the city’s heritage, and to review new construction design to ensure 

compatibility with the character of the district.” 1 INTRODUCTION 1.2 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

The following is a list of what design Standards can 

do: 

1. Provide guidance up front before property 

owners, architects/designers, and contractors 

make plans 

2. Give much more detailed guidance to property 

owners and the HDC 

3. Result in more appropriate changes in the district 

4. Help resolve specific design concerns that may 

be present in the district 

5. Assist the building industry in the understanding 

of district character 

6. Improve quality of new developments 

7. Protect current property values in the district 

8. Increase public awareness about the vision for 

the district 

9. Review demolition requests 

The following is a list of what Standards do not do: 

1. Increase new construction or rehabilitation 

activities 

2. Improve maintenance 

3. Regulate amount/location of new development 

(zoning does that) 

4. Regulate colors or interior design 

5. Ensure the highest quality design 

6. Have a sufficient impact if property owners are 

not made aware of them 

7. Prohibit demolition or changes 

THE ROLE OF DESIGN STANDARDS 

In order to provide more detailed assistance to 

property owners when making changes to their 

properties in these districts, the Commission and 

staff have created this set of design standards. 

They are recommendations for generally accepted 

professional practices of historic preservation 

and are based on the Secretary of the Interior’s 

Standards for Rehabilitation, a set of criteria used 

nationally in such work. 

As a property owner, you are a partner in 

preservation and should refer to these Standards 

whenever you plan changes to your property. 

These Standards help to clarify what is valuable 

and worth preserving in the districts. They explain 

how you can respect these features as you make 

changes or repairs to your historic building or 

design a new building. By becoming familiar with 

these Standards and planning your work according 

to them, you will be using the same tool that is 

used by the HDC to decide whether your proposed 

change is appropriate to the district. 

These Standards are tailored to your community. 

They are based on the study of Charlotte’s historic 

districts, the types of buildings found in those 

districts, preservation issues, and the current 

policies. Specific topics covered in these Standards 

include recommendations for sites, rehabilitation of 

existing buildings, new construction, and additions. 

The design review process is explained as well and 

there are several appendices on related topics. 

BASIC TERMS IN HISTORIC 

PRESERVATION * 

Terms such as preservation, restoration, and 

rehabilitation are often used interchangeably; 

however, they mean different approaches to the 

work performed on a historic structure. 

8. Preservation focuses on the maintenance 

and repair of existing historic materials and 

retention of a property’s form as it has evolved 

over time. 

9. Rehabilitation acknowledges the need to alter 

or add to a historic property to meet continuing 

or changing uses while retaining the property’s 

historic character. This approach must not 

damage or destroy historically significant 

materials, features or finishes and requires that 

any changes be compatible with the building 

and its context. 

10. Restoration depicts a property at a particular 

period of time in its history, while removing 

evidence of other periods. 

11. Reconstruction re-creates vanished or non-

surviving portions of a property for interpretive 

purposes. 

12. Renovation or remodeling makes changes to 

the property without necessarily maintaining 

the historic character-defining features of a 

building. 

*The first four treatments are from the Secretary of 

the Interior’s preservation treatment standards as 

defined by the National Park Service. INTRODUCTION 11.3 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

DISTRICT DO’S AND DON’TS 

Below are some common “Do’s and Don’ts” to help you plan your project and avoid costly mistakes. 

For more details about these and other design situations refer to the appropriate section within 

these Standards. 

MISSION STATEMENT 

It is the responsibility of the members of the 

Historic District Commission to identify and 

protect the overall character of Charlotte’s historic 

neighborhoods that have been designated by 

City Council as Local Historic Districts. It is also 

the recognition that historic resources belong 

to the entire community as part of our collective 

heritage. The members of the Historic District 

Commission and its staff acknowledge that the 

property owners and residents within historic 

districts are the stewards of an important part of 

Charlotte’s visual and associative history. 

In keeping with the preservation of the historic 

neighborhoods’ character, the following 

objectives have been established: 

Protect the unique and vibrant character of each 

designated historic neighborhood. 

1. Maintain the historic human scale, 

pedestrian orientation, and visual variety of 

the streetscape. 

2. Preserve areas of green space and the tree 

canopy. 

3. Manage changes to accommodate 

modern living. 

4. Consider conflicts between the Historic 

District Commission, property owners, 

and other preservation organizations 

when appropriate, knowing that the HDC 

decisions are bound by its Standards. 

Do: Contact staff before ordering windows or 

removing windows. 

Do: Make repairs to original windows rather than 

replace them. 

Do: Design building additions that are not 

incongruous with the design of the structure and 

complementary to the streetscape. 

Do: Use appropriate designs for the building 

type. Example – A simple front porch design is 

compatible with a small cottage style house. 

Do: Repair and maintain your historic building. 

Do Not: Paint previously unpainted masonry 

surfaces. 

Do Not: Use materials that are incompatible with 

the building. Example – Cedar shake siding is not 

compatible with a Georgian style building. 

Do Not: Remove large trees without approval. 

Do Not: Install long expanses of stockade privacy 

fences or chain link fences. 

Do Not: Use interlocking beveled edge concrete 

block or railroad ties for retaining walls or 

landscaping projects. 

Do Not: Add developed parking areas in the front 

setback of the building. 

Do Not: Hesitate to contact staff whenever you 

have questions. 1 INTRODUCTION 1.4 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS

# HISTORIC DISTRICT REVIEW PROCESS 2

The Charlotte Historic District Commission (HDC) was established in 1976 by 

an act of the Charlotte City Council as part of the redevelopment of Fourth 

Ward. Today, the Commission’s responsibilities have grown beyond Fourth 

Ward to include design review and enforcement in other designated Local 

Historic Districts. In addition, the HDC and its Staff provide historic preservation 

education and technical advice for other local government agencies and the 

community at large. 

These design standards are the result of an effort by the Historic District 

Commission and its Staff to provide more detailed information for property 

owners in regard to preserving, rehabilitating, and adding on to their historic 

homes. Guidance is also provided for the design of any new construction in the 

districts as well as for site work. The manual also describes the design review 

process to aid owners in developing and submitting applications for changes to 

their properties. 

The Historic District Commission and its Staff want this manual to be useful 

for anyone needing information on development and renovation in Charlotte’s 

Local Historic Districts. We welcome input and comments from the public. 2.2 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

# 2 HISTORIC DISTRICT REVIEW PROCESS 

THE CHARLOTTE HISTORIC 

DISTRICT COMMISSION 

The Charlotte Historic District Commission (HDC) 

consists of fourteen members appointed by the 

Mayor and City Council. Under a resolution of 

City Council, the HDC has representatives who 

own property, live, or operate businesses within 

the Local Historic Districts. Other members are 

appointed at large from the entire community. A 

majority of the Commission’s members must have 

some demonstrable expertise or experience in the 

areas of neighborhood preservation, architecture, 

planning, history, or other areas directly related 

to the mission of the HDC’s mission. A current 

list of members can be obtained by contacting 

the HDC office. 

All properties within Local Historic Districts are 

under the jurisdiction of the Charlotte Historic 

District Commission. As set forth in UDO Article 

14.1.D, all demolition, construction, additions 

or exterior alterations to these properties must 

be approved in advance by the Historic District 

Commission or its Staff. Failure to gain such 

approval can result in enforcement action. 

Anyone planning work in a Local Historic District 

should contact the Charlotte Historic District 

Commission staff. 

Adminis trative 

Approval 

Project plans reviewed by s taff and the Cer*ficate of Appropriateness issued.

HISTORIC DISTRICT REVIEW PROCESS 22.3 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

of the Charlotte Historic District Ordinance, no 

property within a Local Historic District can be 

altered or improved until the owner consults 

with the staff of the Commission to determine if 

a Certificate of Appropriateness is required. 

2. Repair and Maintenance 

Ordinary repair and maintenance projects do 

not require any review and approval, provided 

the work does not result in any changes in 

design or material. HDC Staff must determine 

if projects are true repair and maintenance, or 

if a Certificate of Appropriateness is necessary. 

The owner should not start any work without 

contacting the staff. For instance, re-roofing 

with in-kind materials does not require review 

and approval. 

3. Filing a Certificate of Appropriateness 

Application 

If a Certificate of Appropriateness is required, 

staff will assist applicants in completing an 

application through the city’s Accela Citizen 

Access (ACA) program on the Historic District 

Commission website and in determining what 

additional documentation will be needed in 

order for a project to be evaluated. Because 

the circumstances of each application and 

each property can differ, the necessary 

documentation can vary widely from proposal 

to proposal. 

All proposals will require a completed, signed 

application form. Most proposals will require 

photographs and some form of drawings, 

the detail of which will be determined by the 

scope of the project. A checklist is included 

on the application form, which can be used to 

determine what will be required to document 

the project. 

APPLYING FOR A CERTIFICATE OF 

APPROPRIATENESS 

The Charlotte Historic District Ordinance requires 

that a Certificate of Appropriateness be obtained 

prior to any exterior change to any property within 

a designated Local Historic District. A Certificate 

of Appropriateness is a document certifying that a 

project within a locally designated historic district 

meets the standards outlined in state and local 

law for such work. A building permit for exterior 

work will not be issued until a Certificate of 

Appropriateness is issued by the Charlotte 

Historic District Commission. Exterior work that 

does not require a building permit must still 

receive a Certificate of Appropriateness before 

work begins. 

The HDC and its staff want to work with all Local 

Historic District property owners to ensure that 

the review and approval process is as quick and 

easy as possible, while making sure that the 

requirements of the ordinance are met. The goal of 

the members and staff of the HDC is to encourage 

historic preservation in Charlotte’s designated 

Local Historic Districts in a way that preserves the 

very qualities and historic fabric that draw people 

to these neighborhoods. Every effort is made to 

find ways to accommodate the needs of property 

owners within the Standards established by the 

HDC under state and local law. 

The following process can guide an applicant 

through the steps of the HDC application and 

review process. 

1. Determining if a Project Requires HDC 

Approval 

Contact the HDC Staff as early as possible in 

the planning of any project. Under the terms 

A Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be 

issued when there is an unresolved violation 

of HDC policy unless the Certificate of 

Appropriateness application includes plans to 

remedy the violation. 

All final versions of plans are due to the HDC 

office according to the application deadline 

schedule posted to the HDC website. Plans 

received later than this will not be forwarded 

to the Commission prior to the meeting and 

will not be considered in any analysis HDC 

Staff prepares for the Commission prior to the 

hearing. 

4. Elevation Requirements 

The HDC Staff will work with applicants to 

determine if detailed elevation drawings are 

required to adequately evaluate an application 

for a Certificate of Appropriateness. 

Consult with HDC Staff to determine if 

elevations are required with an application 

and if a project is eligible for administrative 

approval. 

A. Drawings should not exceed 24” x 

36” in size and be black and white line 

drawings; no colored lines. 

B. All supporting illustrations and photos 

should be submitted to HDC Staff in an 

electronic format. 

C. If paper drawings are submitted, sixteen 

(16) copies are required. 

D. All elevations must be drawn to scale 

and be properly labeled. 

E. Accurate grading must be shown on all 

sides. 2 HISTORIC DISTRICT REVIEW PROCESS 2.4 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

F. All materials must be noted. 

G. Elevation drawings must be submitted 

for all sides affected by the proposed 

work. In the case of small projects or rear 

additions, elevations can be submitted 

for only the elevations involved. 

H. Photographs and/or brochures for 

certain materials, such as replacement 

windows, are required when necessary. 

These submissions will be used by the 

Commission to determine whether or not 

project proposals meet the terms of the 

Charlotte Historic District Ordinance and 

current Commission policies and Standards. 

Requirements of the Mecklenburg County 

Land Use and Environmental Services Agency 

(LUESA) under current building code and 

zoning regulations must be met for all projects, 

regardless of any requirements of the HDC. 

5. Site Plan Requirements 

For many projects, such as new construction, 

additions to existing buildings, parking plans, 

major landscaping, or other similar proposals, 

it will be necessary to provide the HDC with a 

detailed, scaled site plan of the property. 

Consult with HDC Staff to determine if site 

plans are required with your application and 

if your project is eligible for administrative 

approval. 

A. Drawings should not exceed 24” x 36” 

in size. 

All site plans that include parking for non-

residential or multi-family projects must have 

preliminary approval from the Charlotte 

Department of Transportation and have 

approval under the Charlotte Tree Ordinance 

prior to submission to the Charlotte Historic 

District Commission. 

Site plans will be used by the Commission to 

determine whether or not project proposals 

meet the terms of the Charlotte Historic 

District Ordinance and current Commission 

policies and Standards. Requirements of the 

Mecklenburg Land Use and Environmental 

Services Agency (LUESA) under current building 

code and zoning regulations must be met for all 

projects, in addition to any requirements of the 

Historic District Commission. 

B. If at all possible, drawings should be 

submitted electronically via Accela 

Citizen Access (ACA). All drawings 

and supporting illustrations and photos 

should be submitted to HDC Staff 

according to the application deadline 

schedule posted to the HDC website. 

C. If paper drawings are submitted, sixteen 

(16) copies are required. 

Site plans must be scaled or dimensioned from 

measurements of the site, not from estimates, 

and include a landscaping plan as well as all 

appropriate information, such as: 

W Existing features, including all building 

footprints, trees and major shrubbery, walks, 

pools, driveways, curbs, signs, HVAC units, 

fences, curb cuts, dumpsters, etc. 

W Side, front, and rear yard setbacks 

W Indication of existing features to be 

removed 

W Indication of features which would be 

added to the site 

W Accurate dimensions of existing and 

proposed site features, and their 

relationships to each other and to the site 

boundaries 

W Fence and wall heights 

W Buffers 

W Parking requirements 

W Screening of parking areas 

W Landscape plan HISTORIC DISTRICT REVIEW PROCESS 22.5 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

HOW APPLICATIONS ARE EVALUATED 

State and local laws give the HDC clear direction 

on how projects are to be evaluated. The ordinance 

directs the Commission to use the current 

version of The Secretary of Interior’s Standards 

for Rehabilitation , and cites these Standards 

verbatim. These standards were developed by the 

U.S. Department of the Interior to guide federal 

agencies in dealing with historic properties and 

districts under their jurisdiction. Under Charlotte’s 

local ordinance, the HDC is charged with 

developing specific policies dealing with issues 

relating to properties in Local Historic Districts 

using the Secretary’s Standards as a guide. 

In evaluating a project proposal, the HDC and its 

staff refer to the adopted Design Standards that 

are based on the Secretary of Interior’s Standards 

for Rehabilitation. They also examine the specific 

context of the property in question. The Standards 

in this manual are designed to address the more 

common issues that come before the Commission. 

The HDC also recognizes that each property in 

Charlotte’s Local Historic Districts has unique 

qualities, and there are circumstances that warrant 

exceptions to their adopted standards and policies. 

It is the responsibility of a property owner to 

demonstrate to the Commission that an exception 

is justified. 

The Secretary of Interior’s Standards for 

Rehabilitation are listed to the left. In order to deny 

an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, 

the HDC must find that the proposed project 

violates one or more of these standards. 

If you have any questions regarding these 

standards or specific Standards adopted by the 

HDC, please contact the Charlotte Historic District 

Commission Office. 

THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR’S STANDARDS 

The Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Historic 

Rehabilitation (As cited in the Charlotte Unified 

Development Ordinance Article 14) 

1. A property shall be used for its historical 

purpose or be placed in a new use that 

requires minimal change to the defining 

characteristics of the building and its site 

and environment. 

2. The historic character of a property shall 

be retained and preserved. The removal 

of historic materials or alteration of features 

and spaces that characterize a property 

shall be avoided. 

3. Each property shall be recognized as a 

physical record of its time, place, and 

use. Changes that create a false sense of 

historical development, such as adding 

conjectural features or architectural 

elements from other buildings, shall not be 

undertaken. 

4. Most properties change over time; those 

changes that have acquired historic 

significance in their own right shall be 

retained and preserved. 

5. Distinctive features, finishes, and 

construction techniques or examples of 

craftsmanship that characterize a property 

shall be preserved. 

6. Deteriorated historic features shall be 

repaired rather than replaced. Where 

the severity of deterioration requires the 

replacement of a distinctive feature, the 

new one shall match the old in design, 

color, texture, and other visual qualities and, 

where possible, materials. Replacement of 

missing features shall be substantiated by 

documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 

7. Chemical or physical treatments, such as 

sandblasting, that cause damage to historical 

materials shall not be used. The surface 

cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall 

be undertaken using the gentlest means 

possible. 

8. Significant archaeological resources 

affected by a project shall be protected 

and preserved. If such resources must be 

disturbed, mitigation measures shall be 

undertaken. 

9. New additions, exterior alterations, or related 

new construction shall not destroy historic 

materials that characterize the property. The 

new work shall be differentiated from the old 

and shall be compatible with the massing, 

size, scale, and architectural features to 

protect the historic integrity of the property 

and its environment. 

10. New additions and adjacent or new 

construction shall be undertaken in such a 

manner that if removed in the future, the 

essential form and integrity of the historic 

property and its environment would be 

unimpaired. 2 HISTORIC DISTRICT REVIEW PROCESS 2.6 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS

TYPES OF REVIEW & 

MEETING PROCEDURES 

Upon receiving an application for a Certificate 

of Appropriateness (COA), HDC Staff will review 

the application material to ensure that adequate 

information has been submitted to evaluate the 

proposal. If additional information is needed or if 

there is a question about some part of the material, 

staff may contact the applicant for clarification 

or additional information. Once all the necessary 

information is in place, the application will undergo 

one of the two types of review. 

Note: The HDC may grant exceptions to applicable 

> standards in the following situations: building code
> requirements, or site conditions such as topography,
> parcel shape, or other site constraints.

1. Administrative Approval: 

Projects that meet certain criteria can be 

reviewed and approved by staff. Under normal 

circumstances, such reviews usually take no 

more than five to ten working days, from the 

point all required information is supplied by 

the applicant. The review may take longer if 

the building plans are unclear or incomplete. 

In order to receive an administrative approval, 

project proposals must fall within current HDC 

policy. Projects that staff judges to be outside 

these Standards will be referred to the full HDC 

for review. 

The project types listed below are eligible 

for administrative approval by the HDC Staff, 

provided the proposal meets all relevant 

current policies adopted by the Commission. 

Staff has the discretion to refer any application HISTORIC DISTRICT REVIEW PROCESS 22.7 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

2. Referral to Full HDC 

Projects not eligible for administrative approval 

will be placed on the agenda of the next 

available monthly Charlotte Historic District 

Commission meeting. These meetings are held 

on the second Wednesday of each month, and 

application deadlines are available from the 

HDC office. HDC application deadlines and 

meeting dates are updated annually. 

The following types of projects require full 

HDC review: 

• New full construction 

• Additions that are taller or wider than 

the existing structure 

• Additions and new construction on 

corner lots 

• Additions that increase the square 

footage of the original structure more 

than 50% 

• For the complete list see page 2.9 

and 2.10 

For projects requiring an evidentiary hearing 

before the HDC, staff is required by law to 

make reasonable effort to inform all adjacent 

property owners of the hearing. This allows 

anyone potentially affected by a project the 

opportunity to comment on that project. 

“Adjacent” is defined as all parcels within 300 

feet in all directions of the subject property. 

The Charlotte Historic District Commission 

meets the second Wednesday of each month 

at 1:00 p.m. in the Government Center at 600 

East Fourth Street. The Members of the HDC 

will review each application according to the 

following procedure: 

A. Presentation of Application by HDC Staff 

1. Presentation on Property and Outline 

of Proposal 

2. Comments by Staff on the Project 

3. Recommendations and/or Suggestions 

B. Presentation by the Applicant 

C. Testimony by Other Interested Parties 

1. Testimony by Interested Parties 

2. Synopsis of Testimony Received by 

HDC Staff 

D. Consideration by the Historic District 

Commission 

1. Questions by the HDC to Applicant, 

Staff, and Others 

E. Deliberation by the Historic District 

Commission 

1. End of evidentiary hearing and 

discussion amongst Commission Members 

2. Adoption of Findings of Fact by the 

Commission 

3. Final Vote by the Commission 

The final vote of the HDC on an application for a 

Certificate of Appropriateness will lead to one of 

these results: 

A. Approval 

Once approval is granted by the HDC, a 

Certificate of Appropriateness will be issued 

by staff, and a building permit, if necessary, 

can be obtained. Any changes to the plans 

approved by the HDC must be referred to 

the Commission’s staff. If staff determines 

that the change to the plans results in a 

substantive difference from the approved 

plans, the project must go back before the 

Commission. 

B. Approval with Conditions 

The applicant shall satisfy any and all 

conditions within twelve months of the HDC 

decision, unless specified otherwise by the 

HDC in its motion, in order for the HDC 

to issue a Certificate of Appropriateness. 

If the applicant does not satisfy any and 

all conditions and receive verification 

from the HDC Staff for compliance within 

twelve months of the HDC decision, then 

the HDC’s decision shall become null 

and void for failure to comply with the 

required conditions and the project must be 

resubmitted to the HDC .

C. Continuance 

Occasionally, the Commission determines 

a proposal may need some adjustments 

or that additional information is needed 

before final approval can be granted. 

These changes are often beyond what 

can be resolved in the setting of a formal 

Commission meeting. In such cases, the 

HDC may continue final action on the 

application to a future meeting in order 

for the applicant, HDC, and Staff to work 

together to resolve any outstanding issues. 

D. Denial 

A denial by the HDC means that the 

proposed project does not meet the 

Design Standards and that no exceptions 

are warranted. A denied project proposal 

cannot be carried out. A denied application 2 HISTORIC DISTRICT REVIEW PROCESS 2.8 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

cannot be re-submitted to the HDC for a 

period of two months. The Commission will 

make all determinations on resubmissions 

on a case-by-case basis, according to 

information provided by the applicant. 

3. Code Enforcement 

Any changes from or additions to 

the project will void the Certificate of 

Appropriateness unless a new application 

has been approved. There are three 

circumstances that can lead to the 

commencement of enforcement procedures 

against a property owner within a local 

historic district: 

1. Work is done that requires a Certificate of 

Appropriateness without a certificate being 

issued. 

2. A Certificate of Appropriateness is 

denied by the Commission and the project 

is carried out in defiance of the denial. 

3. Work is approved by the HDC or its 

staff and is then carried out in a manner 

inconsistent with the approval. 

When one of the above circumstances 

exists, the following procedure will be 

followed: 

HDC Staff will provide to the Zoning 

Enforcement Supervisor, or a designee, the 

violation to be cited and the address and 

owner of the property where the violation 

has occurred. Zoning Enforcement Staff 

will then pursue the violation through the 

processes outlined in Section 39.2.L of the 

City of Charlotte Unified Development 

Ordinance. Should the violation be 

corrected through established HDC 

procedures, 

HDC Staff will notify the Zoning 

Enforcement Supervisor, or designee, to 

suspend or end the enforcement process 

on the violation in question. 

APPEALS OF DECISIONS OF THE 

HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION 

Any party with standing aggrieved by a decision of 

the Charlotte Historic District Commission has the 

right to appeal the Commission’s decision to the 

Mecklenbury County Superior Court as outlined 

in Section 14.1.M of the City of Charlotte Unified

DEVELOPMENT OVERVIEW OF 

CHARLOTTE’S LOCAL HISTORIC 

DISTRICTS 

The Charlotte City Council has designated 

seven Local Historic Districts, in recognition 

of their significance to the city’s history and 

its architectural heritage. These special areas 

are unique segments of Charlotte’s historic 

development. Most of them grew up around 

the original central business district of the 

community. They represent many of the 

popular architectural styles, building forms, 

and popular tastes of the early to mid-

twentieth century. 

For the most part, these neighborhoods 

retain a large part of their design integrity 

and much of their housing stock is intact. In 

recent decades, these areas have become 

increasingly popular as attractive, interesting, 

and distinctive in-town neighborhoods that 

attract many new residents. The result is 

an increasing level of historic rehabilitation 

and restoration activities throughout these 

districts. The historic designations further 

this interest and help ensure that the very 

qualities that draw so many to these areas will 

be preserved. 

The following pages give a brief overview 

with a map of each district. The primary 

architectural styles and types are then 

discussed and illustrated with various 

drawings and photographs in order to better 

convey this unique architectural heritage.

DILWORTH LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICT 

(Designated 1983, Expanded 1992) 

Since its inception in the 1890’s, Dilworth has been one of Charlotte’s 

most distinctive neighborhoods. Developed as the city’s first suburb, 

Dilworth was connected to downtown by Charlotte’s first electric 

streetcar. The success of the initial development of Dilworth led 

its creator, Edward Dilworth Latta, to expand the neighborhood in 

the 1910’s under a plan by the Olmsted Brothers, then the nation’s 

preeminent landscape architects. Although their plan was never fully 

implemented, Olmsted’s curved roads and dramatic landscaping set the 

tone for much of Charlotte’s future character. In 1987, Dilworth was listed 

in the National Register of Historic Places. 

Dilworth has sub-areas with large residences on large lots, as well as 

mid-scale dwellings on smaller lots. Institutional and small-scale historic 

commercial buildings are also found throughout the district. Street 

layouts may be gridded or in curvilinear patterns. Mature landscaping 

and large street trees create a lush garden-like atmosphere in much of 

this district. 

Lots throughout Dilworth are long and narrow, with residential structures 

sitting close to the street with large rear yards. The lots along the 

major arteries, East Boulevard, Dilworth Road, Dilworth Road East, and 

Dilworth Road West, are larger since these were the most desirable 

locations within the neighborhood when it was established. The homes 

along the grand avenues are larger and more academic in form and 

detailing. On the smaller streets in the grid section, there are generally 

eight lots per block face, with smaller buildings. On the side streets 

in the curvilinear section, there are up to ten lots per block face. The 

buildings on these side streets are uniformly close to the street and to 

each other, often separated by only a narrow strip of grass and a drive 

leading to a garage in the back yard. Small scale multi-family triplexes 

and quadruplexes are also interspersed throughout the neighborhood. 

Although Dilworth was executed in three sections, the grid plan of 1891, 

and the two curvilinear sections of 1912 and 1920, the building patterns 

in the entire neighborhood are surprisingly consistent. The 1890s 

development of the suburb includes representative examples of the late 

Victorian styles, but also the beginnings of a long-term fascination with 

the various forms of the Colonial Revival styles. These were followed

The core of historic structures and landmarks in 

Fourth Ward exists between West 7th Street, North 

Graham Street, West 10th Street, and North Church 

Street. Designated historic landmarks such as the 

old Fire Station Number 4, St. Peter’s Hospital, and 

Old Settlers Cemetery are also located within the 

district. 

FOURTH WARD LOCAL HISTORIC 

DISTRICT 

(Designated 1976) 

In the 1850’s, Fourth Ward was a prosperous 

residential area, convenient to downtown 

businesses and shops. As residential development 

shifted to the suburbs with the opening of Dilworth 

in the late nineteenth century, all of Charlotte’s 

original residential wards would see an eventual 

decline. 

By the 1970’s, many of Fourth Ward’s Victorian 

homes had been demolished or converted

combined efforts of civic and community leaders, 

Fourth Ward underwent a dramatic physical 

revitalization in the 1970s. Today there are various 

examples of restored Victorian homes on the 

narrow streets of the district, as well as a wide 

variety of larger new residential and commercial 

structures.

Stephens Company, a family business of the Myers 

family, developed the overwhelming majority of 

Myers Park while smaller areas were developed by 

other builders. 

Hermitage Court was one of these smaller areas 

and was developed by F. M. Simmons who erected 

the stone gateways that flank each end of the 

street. He also built for himself the house at 625 

Hermitage Court; a grand Colonial Revival style 

house completed in 1913. A 1914 survey map shows 

the layout for Myers Park and includes Hermitage 

Court stretching from Simmon’s home east to 

Providence Road. With the exception of two later

In 1911, a new suburban development was 

announced to be built on the southern edge of 

town. It was carved out of a cotton farm long 

owned by the Myers family and it became Myers 

Park, one of Charlotte’s best known and most 

desirable subdivisions. John Nolen, one of the 

most notable landscape architects and urban 

designers of his day, along with his protégé, Earle 

Sumner Draper, designed Myers Park. Following

multi-family projects, the homes along Hermitage 

Court were all constructed between 1913 and 

1925, and include some of the oldest homes in the 

neighborhood. 

The architecture of Hermitage Court is an eclectic 

mix of Bungalow style houses interspersed with 

examples of several styles that were popular in 

the early 20th Century, including Colonial and 

Tudor Revival homes. Almost a century later, the 

overwhelming majority of the houses retain their 

original architectural character on lots with mature 

landscaping. 

Hermitage Court is characterized both by large and small lots and homes. HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 33.5 3.5 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

PLAZA MIDWOOD LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICT 

(Designated 1992) 

Developed in the 1910s and 1920s, Plaza Midwood is the product 

of several different developments undertaken by various interests. 

These early small neighborhoods grew together over the years to 

become today’s Plaza Midwood. Fluctuating economic conditions 

during the area’s growth and the differing visions of the many 

developers involved came together to create the most eclectic of 

Charlotte’s Local Historic Districts. The Plaza Midwood Local Historic 

District came about as a result of efforts of neighborhood residents. 

Plaza Midwood has two distinct areas. The Plaza is a street divided 

by a median with deep setbacks and larger lots. While the homes 

are generally larger along The Plaza, the street is notable for having 

a range of building heights and a variety of architectural styles 

spanning from two-story Victorian and Craftsman, to the more 

compact, one-story American Small House. The secondary streets 

contain a more modest mix of Bungalow, Cottage, and American 

Small House styles. These dwellings are primarily one, or one-and-

one-half stories in height and have shallower setbacks and smaller 

side yards than the houses along The Plaza.

WESLEY HEIGHTS LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICT 

(Designated 1994) 

Charlotte’s first Local Historic District located on the 

west side of the city, Wesley Heights, retains an amazing 

degree of its original character. The neighborhood was 

developed primarily in the 1920s, and involved some of the 

same interests responsible for the creation of the Elizabeth 

National Register Historic District. 

Wesley Heights has survived some dramatic changes in its 

history, and yet still appears much like it did when it was 

served by Charlotte’s streetcar system with its Bungalow 

style homes and tree-canopied streets. The coordinated 

efforts of Wesley Height’s residents led to the listing of 

the neighborhood in both the National Register of Historic 

Places and as a Local Historic District at the same time.

WILMORE LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICT 

(Designated 2010) 

Wilmore, located to the southwest of downtown 

Charlotte, was developed as a streetcar suburb in 

the early years of the twentieth century. Wilmore 

mirrors the single-family Bungalows and wide 

curvilinear streets and sidewalks of Dilworth and 

shared the streetcar line from the center of town 

with this sister neighborhood. 

The early history of the area that became Wilmore 

included its long use as farmland. It also contained 

parts of Blandville, one of several African American 

villages that lay just outside the town of Charlotte, 

and The Rudisill Gold Mine, one of the most 

productive of the mines that fueled the country’s 

first gold rush in and around Charlotte. 

In 1906, developer F. C. Abbot and the Southern 

Realty Company purchased the land that would 

become Wilmore from several owners. Abbot 

combined the names of two of those former 

owners, the Wilson and Moore families, to create 

the name “Willmore” for the new planned suburb 

just south of rapidly growing Charlotte.

Wilmore Local Historic District 

# ±0 250 500 750 1,000 125 Feet July 24,2017 Produced by The Charlotte Mecklenburg Planning Department 

Wilmore contains a wide range of styles and 

materials in its buildings, with the majority 

exhibiting the low overhanging roofs, full-width 

front porches, and Craftsman details typical of 

the Bungalow style. Although it is primarily a 

single-family neighborhood, Wilmore is also home 

to numerous duplexes, apartment buildings, and 

churches, as well as commercial and industrial 

buildings. 

Wilmore has a similar development pattern to 

Dilworth between South Tryon Street and South 

Mint Street. The street pattern is a traditional grid 

with West Kingston Avenue serving as the broad 

main street through the neighborhood. Older 

dwellings in Wilmore are more modest in scale, with 

traditional Bungalow houses lining the streets. The 

southern section of the neighborhood has a mix of 

Cottage and Bungalow and American Small House 

type dwellings along curvilinear streets with longer 

blocks than the older section. Unlike other historic 

districts, Wilmore contains a notable number of 

American Small House type dwellings which are 

largely found along Merriman Avenue, Wilmore 

Drive, Wood Dale Terrace, and Woodcrest Avenue; 

however, these buildings are also found elsewhere 

in the Wilmore neighborhood. 

Wilmore has a large inventory of smaller scaled, one-story dwell -

ings arranged on compact lots in uniform rows. 3 HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 3.8 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS

American community from 1955 to 1961 in the 

latter days of racial segregation. This prolific 

Charlotte developer created new subdivisions 

in various locations surrounding the existing city 

taking advantage of the post-war housing boom 

and new financial mortgage tools created by the 

Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the 

Veterans Administration (VA). Scholarly studies of 

FHA/VA lending emphasize that African Americans 

received sharply less benefit from this massive 

subsidy than did whites due to segregation and 

lending practices. 

This new financing allowed longer mortgage 

repayment terms (30 years) and thus more families 

with a wider variety of income levels could become 

homeowners for the first time. Warehousemen, 

train conductors, lawyers, small business owners, 

and school principals could all share the same 

street in Oaklawn Park. Much of that diversity 

continues to hold true today throughout the 

neighborhood. 

The FHA preferred to qualify “operative 

developers” for their projects since these firms 

would not only acquire the land, lay out the 

subdivision and streets and sell lot, they would also 

build the houses. This process, under the control 

of one company, could deliver new residential units 

more efficiently to a rapidly growing population 

than just selling lots to individuals who would then 

have to build their own dwelling. 

Oaklawn Park streets are laid out to follow 

the topography of the land as recommended 

by the FHA instead of a strict grid. The entire 

neighborhood is designed to limit connections 

(and thus traffic) to and from surrounding roads and 

other areas. As a result, the district is distinctive 

for its curvilinear streets, deep setbacks, large lots, 

driveways, and sidewalks that connect the driveway 

to the front door. Street sidewalks are not common 

in the district. Mul berry Av Oaklawn A vVinton St Russell Av Vinton St S I-77 Hy Miles CtGrier Av Kay St Dea n StJenn ings St Welch Pl Renner St Heil PlCondon St B oone St Newca st leStGunn St Orvis S tWaddell St N I-77 Hy

Since Ervin’s company controlled all aspects of 

the building process, the designs, size, forms, 

and siting of the resulting ranch houses are quite 

similar. They are all one story, about 1500 square 

feet, with brick veneer walls, often with flagstone 

segments, and most have driveways with the 

entrance walk leading from it. Roofs vary but most 

have shallow pitches, either gable or hipped type 

with overhangs. Asphalt shingles are the typical 

roof material. Window types vary but most houses 

have a large picture window on the front façade. 

Front entries are not obscured and often have 

planters incorporated next to them. Wing walls may 

define the entire façade or only the entry area and 

decorative metal supports may surround the entry 

as well. Carports or side screened porches may be 

present and incorporated within the overall roof 

structure of the dwelling. 

Houses in Oaklawn Park are 

typically unpainted red brick 

with wood gables, metal porch 

columns and details, and dou -

ble- hung wood or aluminum 

windows. HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 33.9 3.9 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

MCCROREY HEIGHTS 

LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICT 

(Designated 2022) 

McCrorey Heights, located just north of Johnson 

C. Smith University off Beatties Ford Road 

and Oaklawn Avenue, is one of Charlotte’s 

most historically important neighborhoods. 

Founded by JCSU president H.L. McCrorey in 

1912, it really took off after World War II as a 

development of ranch-style suburban homes 

for Charlotte’s African American educated elite. 

Many of the men and women who built and led 

key Black institutions in the era of segregation 

made their homes here. College professors and 

administrators resided next to school principals, 

doctors, ministers, and business leaders. Nearly 

every woman worked outside the home, many 

as teachers and administrators in Charlotte-area 

schools. As the Civil Rights movement heated 

up during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, McCrorey 

Heights residents often took the lead locally and 

even nationally. 

McCrorey Heights is one of Charlotte’s best-

preserved neighborhoods from the boom 

decades immediately after World War II. It is 

significant for its architecture, including both pre-

war examples and especially post-war ranch style 

and related designs. It is even more significant for 

its history, as home to numerous African American 

leaders in the era of segregation and in the 

subsequent Civil Rights movement. 

Today, McCrorey Heights looks much as it did 

in its heyday in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 

The rectangular grid of straight streets includes 

five major avenues running up from Irwin Creek: 

Van Buren, Madison, Patton, Washington and 

Oaklawn. Most dwellings front on these streets, 

though a few are on the short cross-streets of 

Andrill Terrace, Creek Street, Clifton Street, 

Fairfield Street, Mulberry Avenue, Condon Street 

and Fairmont Street. 

While some losses have nibbled at the edges of 

the neighborhood, the bulk of McCrorey Heights 

is impressively intact. It looks much as it did half a 

century ago. The predominant architectural form 

in McCrorey Heights is a one-story ranch house, 

constructed in brick, many with stone accents. 

Most homes have driveways with front walks that 

connect the driveway to the front door and/or 

connect the front door to the street. The minimal 

trim popular in the 1950s and 1960s sometimes 

has a hint of Colonial style – multi-paned windows, 

boxed cornices – but more often favors what is now 

termed “Mid-century Modern” simplicity. All of the 

houses appear to be custom-built and distinctive, 

with the exception of four look-alike dwellings on 

Van Buren Avenue. Interviews suggest that many 

residents modified plans that they had selected 

from magazines and newspapers. Neighborhood 

covenants include a requirement for new 

construction to have a traditional masonry exterior 

to conform to the neighborhood’s existing original 

structures. W Brookshire Fr Oaklawn Av Andrill Tr Miles Ct Madison Av S I-77 Exit 10C Ra Creek St Renner St Clifton St Patton Av Fairfield St Blazer Dr Washington Av Van Buren Av

DESCRIPTION OF ARCHITECTURAL STYLES 

Charlotte’s locally designated historic districts have a wide range of 

architectural styles. While the Fourth Ward Historic District dates from 

the late nineteenth century, most of the other districts reflect early to 

mid-twentieth century styles of domestic architecture. The Bungalow 

style is by far the most common example found in these districts and 

there are numerous variations of it. Additional styles of this period such 

as American Foursquare, Colonial Revival, and Tudor Revival are well 

known classifications and are found in Charlotte’s historic districts 

as well. 

Also during this era, there were various forces that brought about 

new residential forms of construction. One of the first influences was 

the creation of several federal government housing demonstration 

projects for World War I factory workers. These dwellings were small, 

very modest, single-family houses designed to strict budgets with 

maximization of usable space. With the onset of the Great Depression, 

World War II, and the post war housing shortage, the need for low-cost 

housing continued unabated. A new collaboration occurred between 

the federal government, the building industry, financing institutions, 

design professions, and building code officials to support this new 

housing movement. 

The result was a new form, now named the American Small House. It is 

a simple one-story rectangular form with minimal decoration and often 

has a gable roof. Because of its simplicity, it is difficult to give this type 

of dwelling any stylistic name but some examples do have a few details 

that can identify with a particular style. Some examples of the American 

Small House are present in Charlotte’s historic districts and contribute 

to the distinctive character of these neighborhoods. 

Sometimes these dwellings are lumped into one name, the ranch house, 

and that term may be appropriate for some larger examples of these 

mid-century modern homes. This term, the ranch house, has many other 

variations in roof forms, materials, and details and there are examples in 

the historic districts. Split-level designs are another variation from this 

era. Both of these house types are included in the following section.    

> Queen Anne American Foursquare
> Colonial Revival Bungalow
> Tudor Revival English Cottage
> Mid-Century Modern

HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 33.11 3.11 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

QUEEN ANNE (1880-1910) 

The Victorian era is closely associated with the 

Queen Anne style of dwelling. It is characterized by 

a complex roof, vertical proportions, asymmetrical 

facades, and elements such as towers and turrets. 

Most examples have a wrap-around porch. 

Decorative tall chimneys and a variety of gable 

forms highlight the skylines of these large-scale 

residences. 

In more elaborate examples, rich decoration 

such as brackets, balusters, window surrounds, 

bargeboards, and other sawn millwork exist with 

various surface materials like shingles, wood siding, 

brick, and stone. Smaller and more vernacular 

examples have a simpler form, vertical proportions, 

and a more restrained use of decorative elements, 

but retain the asymmetrical facades with projecting 

bays and decorative use of materials of the style. 

Forth Ward has the largest remaining collection of 

the Queen Anne high style. Queen Anne cottages 

are found in Wilmore and Dilworth.

This Queen Anne cottage has dual roof gables and a highly decorative porch. 

Here, the front porch ends with a gable and extends to create a porte cochere. 

The central pyramidal tower, decorative brackets, and wrap-around porch help 

define this example of the high style of Queen Anne. 

The complex cross-gable roof with the balcony porch add to the richness of 

this example. HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 33.13 3.13 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

AMERICAN FOURSQUARE (1900-1930) 

Identified by its trademark hipped roof with a deep 

overhang and a dominant central dormer, this style is 

usually two stories with a full-width front porch. 

Openings may or may not be symmetrical between floors. 

Details may reflect the Italianate, Craftsman, or Colonial 

Revival styles. Its name comes from its square-like shape 

and four-room plan. Versions of this house were sold 

across the United States, in prefabricated form, adding 

to its popularity. 

The exterior materials may be brick, wood, stucco, or 

occasionally concrete block. Detailing of porch columns 

varies and can be either classically or Craftsman inspired. 

Foursquare houses often have doors that reflect 

Craftsman detailing, such as a six-light or nine-light styles. 

Windows are often multi-light over one double-hung sash 

and may have shutters to correspond with overall style. 

Dormers typically contain square or double-hung paired 

windows. Eaves are simply detailed with deep overhangs.

This is a rare example of a Foursquare clad in brick and has a central entrance 

instead of sidehall plan. 

This rare duplex example of the Foursquare is naturally a larger scale dwelling. 

This Foursquare also has a full width front porch and hip roof, however, the 

larger centered dormer and central entry varies the building design. HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 33.15 3.15 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

COLONIAL REVIVAL (1910-1940) 

The Colonial Revival style is based on the earlier Georgian 

and Federal periods of American architecture in the late 

eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It often has a 

rectangular plan, symmetrical façade, and a center hall 

and is typically constructed of brick or wood. The roof 

may be a gable or a hipped design. The Dutch Colonial 

version has a gambrel roof. 

The details are always classical and porticos over 

entrances are common. As in earlier periods, the windows 

have small panes; their proportions, however, are often 

more horizontal and the first floor may contain paired or 

triple windows. Doorways can have various elements 

including sidelights, fanlights, pediments, and columns 

or pilasters.

This hip roof, three-bay example has a central entrance capped with a pedi -

ment containing a semi-circular fanlight over the door. 

This frame, five-bay, gable-roof example has roof dormers with pediments that 

relate to the pediment of the central entrance portico. 

The “Dutch Colonial” is actually a gambrel roof variation. Here the central entry 

has an elliptical fanlight with sidelights. Paired 6-over-6 windows are typical. 

This one and one-half story example reflects a Cape Cod variation with its 

trademark dormers and classical entry porch with Roman Doric columns. HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 33.17 3.17 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

BUNGALOW (1915-1940) 

This typically one-and-a-half-story residential 

dwelling can be found in several variations 

throughout the Charlotte Local Historic Districts. 

This house form was often sold in prefabricated 

packages. One of the more common variations 

is the sweeping side-gable form with a massive 

roof that contains a large dormer extending over 

a front porch. Other variations include cross-gable 

and hipped roof forms. Roof overhangs are usually 

deep and contain large simple brackets and 

exposed rafter ends. 

Windows may be in pairs; and there are frequently 

side bays. Front porch supports usually have 

short, squat proportions. Materials are often 

combined on Bungalows and may include brick, 

shingles, stucco, wood, stone, and combinations 

of the above. The selection of materials and the 

decorative details often relate to the stylistic 

version of the Bungalow design.

forms when analyzing the massing arrangement of roofs, roof 

dormers and porches. HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 33.19 3.19 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

TUDOR REVIVAL (1920-1940) 

These dwellings have asymmetrical facades with complex 

gable roof lines. Multi-paned windows used on this 

house can be casement, double-hung, or leaded glass. 

It is common to find narrow casement windows with 

leaded diamond or rectangular panes, often arranged 

in multiple groups. Chimneys are often massive and 

prominent and are sometimes crowned by decorative 

chimney pots. Chimneys often have multiple flues with 

decorative brick patterning. 

Tudor Revival houses tend to be frame with brick veneer 

or stucco and have false half-timbering as their dominant 

feature. Some Charlotte examples also feature decorative 

stone quoins that are large stone or brick surrounds used 

to accentuate features of the dwelling such as doors 

and corners. Tudor Revival designs may feature arched 

doorways accented by a keystone, often set in a steeply 

pitched cross-gable.

with its massive chimney, projecting gables, and wall dormers. 

This smaller scale Tudor Revival has the trademark brick walls with half-timber 

framing, multiple gables, a large tapered chimney, and arched openings. 

This Bungalow form uses the half-timber framing in its porch dormer gable to 

help define its Tudor Revival style. 

Sets of triple 6-over-1 windows, a massive chimney, and half-timber framing 

are typical elements in this example; note the front terrace, which is seen in 

several examples throughout the districts as well. HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 33.21 3.21 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

ENGLISH COTTAGE (1920-1940) 

This English Cottage is a smaller and simpler version of 

the large Tudor-style residences that echoed medieval 

English styles. Typically, one to two stories, these houses 

are characterized by asymmetrical facades, cross-gables, 

steeply pitched roofs, and in many cases, a catslide roof 

over the entry (one side of the roof is longer than the 

other and it curves out close to or past the first floor level). 

Occasionally, these dwellings may feature a roof where the 

shingles wrap over the roof’s edge creating a thatch-like 

appearance. Large-scale chimneys with decorative brick 

or stonework, as well as chimney pots, are often a design 

features within the façade of the house. 

Common siding materials include stucco, brick, and wood. 

Windows are typically tall, narrow, multi-light bands of 

casement types. They may be leaded and/or diamond-

paned. Doorways are often arched or half-round with 

decorative hardware and, in some cases accented by 

quoins and a keystone.

MID-CENTURY MODERN 

This broad term refers to a wide variety of domestic 

architectural forms and styles from the post-World 

War II era through the early 1970s. There are several 

types found in Charlotte’s historic districts and they 

include the following: 

American Small House (1945-1965) 

These modest dwellings became very popular in 

the decades around the mid-twentieth century and 

they were a response to changing economic and 

demographic conditions. The Great Depression 

and the end of World War II created a tremendous 

demand for large numbers of inexpensive single-

family homes. The resulting house types became 

known as the American Small House and it is more 

of a form and plan designation than an architectural 

style. 

Charlotte’s historic districts have some examples 

of this new type and they are typically clad in brick 

or wood siding and have gable roofs. Decoration 

is minimal; some may contain elements of the 

Colonial Revival, Cape Cod or English Cottage 

styles. Often these small dwellings are mistakenly 

called ranch houses. In general, ranch houses are 

larger and are more horizontal in their form and 

may also have large overhanging hip roofs. 

In the Oaklawn Park Historic District, there is a 

unique form of this American Small House/Ranch 

House since the entire neighborhood was designed 

and built by one developer in the 1950’s. The result 

is a series of variations of one-story brick dwellings 

that have very similar forms, materials, and scale. 

Areas of buff colored stone often highlight the 

entrance or parts of the facade. Decorative cast 

aluminum columns support small front porches 

or parts of the projecting roof. Brick wing walls 

project from the entry area to break up the facade. 

Original windows often were aluminum organized 

in stacks of horizontal panes, as were shutters and 

some door examples. This uniformity creates a very 

cohesive physical and visual character throughout 

the district and many examples retain a high 

degree of integrity of their original design.

# 3 HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 3.24 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

Ranch (1950-1970) 

This example of mid-century modern architecture 

refers to the long, one-story home with interlocking 

hipped or shallow pitched gable roofs and deep 

overhanging eaves. Materials may be wood, brick, 

stone, shingle or a combination of any of those 

claddings. Large low chimneys, picture windows 

and bands of windows often help define this 

domestic type. Entrances typically are recessed 

from the varied plane of the facade. 

Split-Level (1950-1975) 

The split-level house became a very popular type 

in this era and its two-level arrangement allowed a 

larger amount of square footage without increasing 

its footprint. The main level of the house usually 

contained the living and dining areas along with 

the kitchen while the upper level contained the 

bedrooms. The level beneath the bedrooms often 

contained a family room (a new space often related 

to the rise of the television and the need for play 

areas for growing families). 

Split-level houses are usually clad in a combination 

of brick veneer and wood siding and frequently 

have small paned windows with shutters. Roofs 

are gable forms, often with an end chimney. The 

upper level of the two-story section may have an 

overhang over the lower level. 

Bi-Level (1950-1975) 

This residential form is a variation of the split level 

design. The bi-level is a two-story dwelling with 

the main entrance in between the two levels. Thus, 

there is one continuous roof over the entire house. 

The entrance is raised so when one enters, there is 

the staircase and you must go up or down; there is 

no level at the level of the entrance.

MULTI-UNIT HOUSING TYPES 

Many of the historic districts in Charlotte have examples 

of multi-unit residential housing including duplex, triplex, 

fourplex, and multi-family buildings with more than four 

dwellings. Duplexes and fourplexes have historically been 

woven into the districts and generally blend with the single-

family style dwellings in terms of scale, materials, form, 

massing, etc. In that regard, an analysis of the immediate 

historic context is essential to any new multi-family 

construction. 

Duplex 

A duplex is a house divided into two units with their own 

entrances. In Charlotte, there are a variety of duplex 

examples in the historic districts. Examples range from one-

story bungalow type duplexes with units side by side on one 

floor, to two-story buildings with either one unit over another 

or side-by-side units with both units having two floors.  

> Example of two-story, one-over-one duplex Example of two-story, side,by-side duplex
> Example of one-story, side-by-side duplex

# 3 HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 3.26 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

Triplex 

A triplex is a house divided into three units with 

their own entrances or a shared entrance. Units are 

on two or three floors. 

Fourplex (Quadraplex) 

A Fourplex is a house divided into four separate 

units either with shared or separate access. There 

are various examples of this type of multi-family 

house found within and outside the historic 

districts in Charlotte. 

This triplex example has three entrances at the first 

floor level. 

This example of a fourplex shows four separate access points with three being on 

the front elevation and one on the side giving each unit its own entrance. HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 33.27 3.27 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

Multi-family 

Multi-family buildings are defined in the Charlotte 

zoning code as being above four dwelling units. 

They can be similar to a fourplex with either 

a shared or separate access to the units. This 

building type typically has a street-front elevation 

width that matches the width of historic houses in 

its context or the street front mass is modulated to 

complement the rhythm of houses in its context. 

These newer multi-family examples -

above in Dilworth and below in Wesley 

Heights- are examples of new construc -

tion that fit well in the historic context 

including roof forms, materials, massing, 

windows, and details. 

Facade and roof forms help to break down 

the mass of these multi-family buildings. 

Understanding the historic context for new multi-story, multi-family 

developments is essential in Charlotte’s historic districts. Many of 

the districts have historic multi-story developments. These two ex -

amples, above, provide interesting insights. Both are in Fourth Ward. 

The example on the left is five stories and is on the edge of a 

single-family neighborhood. At the time it was built, its scale was 

reduced by the massing, materials, and fenestration so that it tries to 

relate to the neighborhood. Over the years taller new construction 

has surrounded the building giving scale to its height. 

On the right, this three-story multi-family on the edge of Fourth 

Ward has width, setbacks, materials and elements that complement 

the historic single-family houses. While it has an additional story, the 

building scale works with its historic neighbors. 

The image above shows the new multi-family 

development in the context of historic multi-family 

buildings. 3 HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 3.28 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

Townhouses or Rowhouses 

These two to three-story narrow single units are placed side by side with common 

dividing walls. The narrow side faces the street and has the entrance to the unit. 

Parking, if included, is off a rear access drive. The grouping of townhouses or 

rowhouses in the Charlotte historic districts will depend on the context of the new 

construction. For most of the residential areas in the historic districts, three to five 

townhouses per building mass could be the typical arrangement depending on 

the particular site and neighboring dwellings. 

Cottage Courtyard 

A courtyard multi-family site is often configured around 

a common green that typically runs perpendicular to the 

street. This layout works well for deep sites. The buildings 

are generally small, single unit cottages with the street side 

cottages being oriented to the street. 

This diagram illustrates how a cottage courtyard can fit multiple units on a site 

while respecting the scale and character of the historic district. These newer townhouses in Fourth Ward maintain the street -

front character of a historic district with porches, pedestrian 

access, materials and massing. The mansard front roof and 

boxed chimneys are the only elements that keep the structure 

from being completely successful as townhouses. 

In Dilworth, this historic row 

house development main -

COMMERCIAL BUILDING TYPES 

Many of the historic districts in Charlotte have 

examples of commercial-style buildings including 

one and two story historic mixed-use buildings 

with storefronts on the first floor, historic 

warehouse-factory buildings, residential dwellings 

converted to commercial, and new multistory 

commercial buildings. There are few streets that 

have contiguous commercial buildings; however, 

Mint Street in Wilmore and East Boulevard in 

Dilworth are examples of districts with commercial 

buildings. Fourth Ward has several two-story 

historic commercial buildings but more importantly, 

the area has had significant new, multi-story 

construction. 

Historic Commercial Buildings 

This building type was designed with retail 

storefronts on the first floor and, if more than one 

story, the upper floors were used typically for office 

or inventory storage with windows. These buildings 

are usually set up to the sidewalk and have no 

setback.

Historic Warehouse-Factory Buildings 

This building type is found scattered throughout 

the historic districts. For a factory-type use, the 

building has large, usually steel, windows. Other 

warehouse buildings have loading doors and are 

set back from the street to allow for trucks to load 

and unload. This building type typically does not 

have storefronts. 

This example on Mint Street in Wilmore although 

altered, is a good example of a warehouse/indus -

trial type structure. 

This one-story historic structure, just outside of the 

Forth Ward historic district, is a good example of a 

historic warehouse type building. 

Residential Style Buildings 

This type of commercial building is typically a 

house that has been converted to commercial use. 

A large number of this type of commercial building 

is found on East Boulevard in Dilworth. There 

are also examples of new commercial buildings 

designed in a residential style in order to blend 

with the historic context of the district. 

The bungalow on East Blvd. in Dilworth (top) has been 

carefully converted to commercial use. 

The new infill building (bottom) uses residential forms, 

roofs, and setback to blend in with neighboring build -

ings. The drive-through on the left provides hidden park -

ing in the rear and allows for a landscaped front lawn. 

Commercial Buildings less than 50 years Old 

Scattered throughout the districts are a variety of 

one and two-story newer commercial buildings that 

employ a variety of design features and materials 

from very contemporary to more traditional. These 

buildings are not considered as “context” for new 

construction in the historic districts. 

These more recent commercial buildings are on East 

Blvd. in Dilworth. They contrast with the historic residen -

tial dwellings that have been converted to commercial 

uses. HISTORic Districts AND ARCHITECTURE 33.31 3.31 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

Multi-story new construction on first 3-5 floors (Fourth Ward) 

New construction in Fourth Ward is typically multi-story , when a 

tower element is included in the project design, then the HDC 

reviews only the base element of the project , which is typically the 

first 3-5 stories. 

The new infill mixed-use building in Fourth Ward (left) uses setbacks of upper stories and 

contrasting materials to create a traditional pedestrian street level design. 

The apartment building above likewise uses different materials at the first two 

levels to break up the mass and scale of the design while maintaining a street edge form. REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 44.1 

This chapter discusses the elements that comprise a historic building. It

1. Insulation 

Most heat loss occurs through the attic, 

not through windows. Adding 3.5 inches 

of insulation to the attic has three times 

the impact of replacing single pane 

windows with the most energy-efficient 

replacement windows. 

2. Weatherstripping 

Install weatherstripping around the 

edges of exterior doorways, on window 

rails, and when space allows, between 

window sash and jamb. 

3. Sash Locks 

Install locks on the meeting rail to assure 

a tight fit between the upper and lower 

sashes of windows. 

4. Caulking and Putty 

Caulk joints/seams around the edges 

of window frames to avoid moisture 

penetration. Replace deteriorated 

glazing putty and repaint to create a 

weather-tight seal. 

5. Storm Windows and Doors 

Installing storm windows and doors 

can save energy and provide increased 

comfort by reducing air leakage. 

Replacement of original, character-

defining doors and windows is strongly 

discouraged in Charlotte’s local historic 

districts. 

TECHNICAL INFORMATION Energy audits can be a useful tool for owners of 

historic homes in order to identify where heat 

loss occurs and where conservation measures 

should be instituted. Go to http://www.energy. 

gov/public-services/homes/home-weatherization/ 

home-energy-audits for more information. 

Historic exterior elements, such as porches, 

transoms, shutters, awnings, and trees also play a 

role in energy conservation and should be retained 

and maintained. 

ENERGY CONSERVATION AND 

HEAT LOSS IN HISTORIC HOMES 

By understanding the way a house loses heat, it 

is possible to reduce energy costs without a large 

investment of time or money. 

Listed here are a number of projects to reduce 

heat loss that can easily be completed by most 

homeowners and result in significant energy 

savings. 

> Through ducts and fireplaces: 20-30% Through the walls: 20-30% Through the floor: 10-15% Through the gaps around doors: 10-15% Through the windows: 10-15% Through the roof: 30-40%

FOUNDATIONS 

A foundation forms the base of a building. 

Foundations on many of the houses in Charlotte’s 

historic districts are constructed of a masonry 

material such as brick, stone or stucco. In most 

styles, the foundation material contrasts with the 

wall material of the building. The exception to 

that treatment can be seen in mid-century modern 

buildings where the wall material continues to 

grade and the foundation is only marked by vents 

or possibly a header row of brick. 

STANDARDS 

For Foundations: 

1. Ensure that land is graded so that water flows 

away from the foundation, and if necessary, install 

drains around the foundation. 

2. Remove any vegetation that may cause structural 

disturbances at the foundation. 

3. Do not install pavement up to the foundation. 

4. Retain any decorative vents that are original to the 

building and keep any foundation vents open so 

that air flows freely. 

5. Repair and replace deteriorated foundation 

materials such as brick and mortar. Match existing 

historic materials as closely as possible. Do not 

cover the foundation with wall cladding materials 

such as replacement siding. 

6. Do not paint unpainted brick or stone 

7. Avoid parging or covering of brick or block with a 

coating of mortar to create a stucco appearance 

where it will have a detrimental effect on the 

performance of the material. If a masonry 

foundation has deteriorated, the cause of the 

deterioration needs to be identified and corrected 

instead of parging over it. 

Brick is commonly found as a foundation material on 

many of the houses in all of the districts. 

Stucco, like brick, provides a contrasting foundation 

material on this example. 

Here, the stone foundation material is also incorporated 

into the chimney and bases for the porch columns. This 

technique is commonly found in the districts. 

Masonry buildings often have the same material as the 

foundation, as seen in this brick dwelling. REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 44.5 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

6. Place skylights, solar collectors, satellite dishes, 

and other antennae on less visible locations of the 

roof. No changes to the roof structure should be 

made to accommodate these elements. 

7. Place roof-mounted mechanical equipment behind 

a parapet wall or a screen integral to the building’s 

architectural design, or locate them in setback 

locations away from the edge of the roof to 

minimize their visibility. 

8. Metal roofs should be pre-finished, factory coated. 

Do not install a roof with bright colors or that is 

raw anodized aluminum. More neutral, traditional 

roof colors should be used, such as shades of grey, 

brown and black. 

ROOFS 

One of the most important elements of a 

structure, the roof serves as the “cover” to protect 

the building from the elements. Good roof 

maintenance is absolutely critical for the roof’s 

preservation and for the preservation of the rest 

of the structure. 

Increasing the roof height is not appropriate for 

most historic structures. However, simple roof 

forms of one story structures may accommodate 

a slight increase while retaining the original form. 

Older architectural styles with complex roof forms 

(e.g. Bungalow, Tudor, Victorian) typically do not 

accommodate an increase of the original ridgeline 

successfully and is not recommended. 

Commercial buildings often have sloped or flat 

roofs hidden by a parapet wall. They may be 

a metal, a built-up tar and gravel or a rubber 

membrane roof. 

4. Replace historic roof coverings when necessary, 

using new material that matches the original roof 

covering closely in composition, size, shape, color, 

and texture. If the slate on a roof has deteriorated 

severely, replace it with matching new slate. (Leaks 

in slate roofs usually are due to the deterioration 

of associated flashing and fasteners or due to 

wood deterioration surrounding hidden gutters or 

cornices.) 

5. When replacing a metal roof, the installation 

should replicate a historic standing-seam roof 

that has a thin raised seam at the joints created 

by mechanically or hand-folding and locking the 

seam. Note: Some pre-coated metal roofs are 

designed for new industrial buildings and have 

larger grooves with snap lock seams and a wide 

V-shaped cap at the gable ridge. This type of 

installation does not replicate a historic standing-

seam roof and should not be used. 

STANDARDS 

For Roofs: 

1. Retain original or early roof materials, such as 

slate, clay tile, or standing-seam metal whenever 

possible. Many mid-20th century homes originally 

would have had asphalt shingle roofs and that 

material should be continued when replacement is 

necessary. 

2. Preserve original roof shapes. 

3. Retain architectural features including dormers, 

cornices, exposed rafter tails, and chimneys. New 

dormers should be appropriately designed for the 

style of the structure in massing and material. Do 

not add skylights unless placed inconspicuously. 

Skylights must be flush mount and must not 

impact the roof system. Repair of roof materials 

and elements should be made in-kind with 

materials that duplicate the original materials. 

National Park Service Preservation Brief #04 

Roofing for Historic Buildings 

www.nps.gov/history/hps/tps/briefs/brief04.htm 

TECHNICAL INFORMATION 

Slate is a distinctive 

material used on 

houses throughout 

the districts. This 

example is from 

Hermitage Court. Standing-seam metal roofs are 

not commonly found in the districts 

but are occasionally found on 

porches (left), bay windows and other 

secondary locations. Standing-seam is 

frequently used on commercial roofs. 

Asphalt shingle roofs are 

commonly found throughout the 

districts such as this examples in 

Oaklawn (above). 4 REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 4.6 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

GUTTERS 

Gutters and downspouts provide a path to direct 

water away from your building and its foundation. 

The shape, size and materials of gutters and 

downspouts may contribute to or detract from the 

historic character of your building. 

STANDARDS 

For Gutters: 

1. Retain existing metal gutters and downspouts. 

Repair existing gutters and downspouts and 

provide ongoing maintenance to prevent their 

deterioration. Built-in gutters, which were 

common during the period when many of 

Charlotte’s properties were built, are considered 

important design elements and should be repaired 

and preserved. 

2. Replace gutters and downspouts to match the 

original. In most instances, the historic profile 

of the gutter is a half-round rather than an ogee, 

square, or rectangular shape. Avoid the removal 

of historic fabric from the building when installing 

gutters and downspouts. 

3. Make certain new metal gutters and downspouts 

are of the appropriate size, scale, and are factory 

clad. Ensure that the finish color is compatible with 

the overall color scheme for the building. 

4. All downspouts should be placed as unobtrusively 

as possible. Avoid placing gutters down front 

elevation(s). 

Directing water away from the foundation at the ground 

level can be aided with a splash block like that found in 

this example. 

Well placed and properly installed gutters and downspouts are essential 

for protection from moisture infiltration.

CHIMNEYS 

Chimneys are key visual and functional elements to 

historic homes in Charlotte’s historic districts and 

they provide ventilation for fireplaces and possibly, 

furnaces. 

STANDARDS 

For Chimneys: 

1. Retain original chimneys and any of their 

decorative features. 

2. Repair existing chimneys as needed with matching 

materials and mortar joints. 

3. Avoid removing any primary masonry chimney 

that is substantially visible from the street and 

that provides a strong contributing element to the 

character of the historic building. 

4. Secondary chimneys or flues that are located to 

the rear of the building in less visible areas may be 

considered for removal if necessary. 

5. The addition of a new masonry chimney that is 

substantially visible from the street is discouraged. 

6. New chimneys associated with new additions 

will be evaluated under Standards for new 

construction and additions. 

There is a wide variety of forms, materials, and details 

found on chimneys in Charlotte’s historic districts. They 

are a functional feature and may be an important design 

element, depending on the style. Many of the English 

Cottage (top left) and Tudor Revival (top right) houses 

have a prominent chimney feature as a part of the front 

elevation. Colonial Revival residences (above left) are 

anchored on each end with prominent chimneys. The 

chimney is within the volume of the house, such as the 

Foursquare Craftsman house on the above right, and 

does not have a prominent exterior expression. This 

Mid-Century Modern example shows a large prominent 

chimney projecting from the facade of the house and in 

Oaklawn Park, chimneys often have stone elements 

mixed in with the brick (right). 4 REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 4.8 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

PORCHES 

Porches are often the focus of historic buildings in 

Charlotte’s historic districts and have traditionally 

been a social gathering place as well as a 

transitional area between the interior and exterior. 

There are a wide variety of styles and types of 

porches that are defined by their size, location, and 

individual elements such as doors, piers, columns, 

railings, cornices, brackets, and other decorative 

features. 

STANDARDS 

For Porches: 

1. Retain porches that are critical to defining the 

design and integrity of the historic district. Keep 

porches open to provide shade and reduce heat 

gain during warm weather. 

2. Repair and replace only damaged elements of 

porches by matching the materials, methods of 

construction, and details of the existing original 

fabric. Avoid stripping porches and steps of 

original materials and architectural features such 

as handrails, balusters, columns, and flooring. 

3. Reconstruct missing elements based on physical 

or photographic detail including all details and 

materials. 

4. Avoid enclosing porches on a primary elevation 

or alter a front porch that reorients the entrance 

away from the street elevation. Porch enclosures 

are evaluated on a case-by-case basis with context 

being a significance factor (ex: the commercial 

corridors of East Blvd. and Park Rd. are very 

different than residential areas). 

5. Enclosure of side porches and balconies is 

discouraged. If enclosure of a side porch or 

balcony is required for a new use, the enclosure 

should be designed to ensure that the historic 

character and features of the porch are preserved. 

Porches vary depending on the style of the house, the materials used, and the whim of the builder and owner at the 

time of construction. From classical porticoes (top left) to highly ornate Victorian porches (top right) and all variety 

of porch designs found on Bungalows and Foursquares (bottom left and right), Charlotte’s historic districts are 

distinctive for the prominence of their porches. 

6. If enclosure of a front porch, side porch or 

balcony is required for a new commercial use, 

the enclosure should be designed to ensure 

that the historic character and features of 

the porch are preserved, and the project is 

completely reversible (i.e., ceiling and floors 

remain intact). Porch enclosures should be 

designed to include as much glass as possible 

with the front thermal wall of the house and 

original porch features visible from the 

public realm. 

7. Original or historic porch railing designs may 

need to be adapted to meet the building code. 

The use of booster rails may be an appropriate 

solution to make the original balustrade code-

compliant. REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 44.9 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

These examples are of screened porches. On the top left, a rear portion of the front porch was screened without 

having a major visual impact on the original design of the dwelling’s facade. The example on the right screens in only 

one bay of the porch while maintaining the original railing. 

When enclosing side or secondary porches ensure that the open character of the porch is maintained as in these 

examples using screen on the left and glass on the right. 

In many examples of the Mid- Century Modern designs 

in Oaklawn Park, the porch area contains a recessed 

entry next to a larger built-in planter, terminated by a 

brick wing wall or ornamental or circular metal columns. 

Some sun porches on mid-century modern houses are 

enclosed with jalousie windows. 

This front porch (left) is carefully 

enclosed with glass to maintain its 

historic form while the historic front 

door is retained as well. 4 REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 4.10 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

FRONT DOORS AND ENTRANCES 

Charlotte’s historic districts have a rich variety 

of entrance features including doors, sidelights, 

trim, transoms, decorative glass, and hardware. 

The entrance separates the public from private 

space, provides security, and helps provide natural 

ventilation. 

For Front Door and Entrances: 

1. Retain and repair all existing features and 

materials of the historic entrance and front door. 

2. Replace historic doors that are beyond repair with 

a new door of the same size, design, material, and 

types as used originally, or sympathetic to the 

building style, including number and orientation 

of panel and location and size of any glass. Do 

not use generic or ”stock” doors with details that 

provide a false sense of historical accuracy. 

3. Do not replace original trim with trim that conveys 

a different period, style, or theme. 

4. Do not reduce or enlarge entrances or door 

openings. 

5. A storm door, if used, should meet the following 

Standards: 

a. Construct storm doors of wood, clad, or a 

composite material that can be sawn and 

painted, or painted metal. 

b. Relate openings for screen or glass panels 

to the proportions of the door. Storm doors 

should avoid obscuring the design of the front 

door. 

c. Paint the storm door the same color as the main 

door or the trim color. 

6. Do not relocate the primary front entrance. 

Conversions to other uses that require relocation 

will be evaluated on a case by case basis. 

Colonial Revival-style houses typically have six-panel 

doors with fan lights and sidelights. 

Doors and entrances on houses with Craftsman details 

have a variety of patterns of divided lights. 

English Cottage examples may have arched doors and 

arched entryways as seen in this example. 

This original Mid-Century Modern door is composed 

of a flush surface with three vertically stacked square 

panes of glass. 

7. If a residentially-designed building is being 

converted (or has been converted) to commercial 

uses, the residential-styled original front door 

should be retained. If it is too deteriorated to 

preserve, the new replacement should meet the 

Standards as described above. 

This is a good example of a residential dwelling that 

has been converted to a commercial use but retains 

important historic facade elements like the original front 

porch, door and surrounding sidelights, and transoms as 

well as the front bay window. 

STANDARDS REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 44.11 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

TRIM 

The trim of a building helps define doors, windows, 

porches, cornices, eaves, projections, and dormers. 

It is important in helping to define the style and 

character of houses in the historic districts. Retain 

all original trim that defines the architectural 

character of the historic building. 

STANDARDS 

For Trim: 

1. Repair rather than replace existing historic trim, 

matching original materials, details, and profiles. 

2. Match deteriorated trim with new trim to match as 

closely as possible in material, details, and profiles. 

Do not remove elements that are part of the 

original design of the structure without replacing 

them in-kind. 

3. Replace missing trim based on physical evidence. 

Do not replace original trim with material that 

conveys a different period of construction or 

architectural style. 

4. Avoid using substitute materials such as fiberglass, 

composites, engineered wood, and PVC type 

products when repairing or replacing historic 

wood elements. In general, the use of these new 

materials may be more appropriate on 

new buildings. 

Trim is a significant component in defining styles such as the column and eave details on the Bungalow (left) and the 

flat board trim of the stucco upper story on the Tudor Revival (right). 

Decorative turned wood defines this Queen Anne style porch while the Colonial Revival style house on the right has 

large carved brackets supporting the entrance gable. 

Wood is used for the trim surrounds, columns, eaves, railings, and brackets of the Bungalow above left while the 

Mid-Century Modern example uses wood only on the windows and trim, eaves and gable elements. 4 REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 4.12 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS

The Repair of Historic Wooden Windows 

www.nps.gov//history/hps/tps/briefs/ 

brief09.htm 

TECHNICAL INFORMATION 

WINDOWS 

Windows are one of the major character-defining 

features on most buildings and because of the 

variety of architectural styles and periods in the 

historic district, there is a corresponding variation 

of windows. Their frames, sills, lintels, sashes, 

panes, decorative caps, and shutters contribute to 

their distinctive physical character. 

They may occur in regular intervals or in 

asymmetrical patterns and there may be a variety 

of types within the design of the building. Windows 

add light to the interior of a building, provide 

ventilation, allow emergency egress, and are a 

visual link to the outside. 

The demands of modern energy efficiency 

and security standards, along with marketing 

campaigns from window manufacturers, have 

led some owners of older buildings to consider 

replacement windows. The following information 

will help owners better evaluate the actual need for 

replacement windows. 

> Windows range from single light, such as the Foursquare on the left to six-over-six light found on Colonial Revival
> houses on the right.
> Bungalows with the Craftsman style influence usually have multi-light over single light windows such as the two

RESTORE OR REPLACE HISTORIC WINDOWS? 

Since these neighborhoods are designated as 

Local Historic Districts, an essential community 

goal is to preserve the architecture that defines 

the districts’ special character. Retaining 

original windows is an important element 

within that goal. In this context, there is an 

ongoing concern about the desire of many to 

replace historic windows with new ones. While 

there may be an occasional instance where 

replacement is unavoidable, there are many 

reasons to retain the historic windows. 

Consider the following information much of 

which is from: http://www.oldhouseguy.com/ 

windows/. This site contains a wealth of details 

about historic windows and their replacement 

as well as other valuable information on historic 

houses. 

Old Windows are Built with 

High-Quality Materials 

Most windows made before 1940 are from old 

growth wood that is denser and more durable 

than much more quickly grown wood from 

modern tree farms. Early growth wood may 

provide better resistance to water and insect 

damage. 

Old Windows Can Be Repaired 

Since historic wooden windows are made of 

individual parts, deteriorated sections can be 

removed and replaced when needed and the 

life of the window extended. Many historic 

structures, even those going back to the 

18 th century still retain their historic windows 

because prior owners simply repaired them. In 

contrast, many modern windows made of vinyl, 

aluminum, fiberglass, or composite materials 

are made as one unit and if part of it fails, the 

entire window may need to be replaced. 

Old Windows Fit Their Openings 

Original windows were made to fit specific 

openings and wood typically shrinks or expands 

with changes in the weather. When new windows 

are placed in these openings, they likely will not 

fit well and adjustments may have to be made to 

surrounding framing, or siding. 

Old Windows Are Energy Efficient 

Increasingly, energy studies are showing that 

a properly maintained historic window with 

weather stripping and a storm window is just as 

efficient as a new double-paned window unit . In 

fact, the historic example may be more efficient 

because the air space between it and the storm 

is likely larger than the space of a double paned 

unit and this space provides more insulation 

value. If the historic window has leaks, there are 

various ways to improve the fit and reduce gaps 

without replacing the entire unit. 

Replacement Windows Save You Money 

Many current sales pitches emphasize how 

much money you can save by replacing your old 

window. New windows are expensive and the 

payback time for replacing a functioning historic 

window with a storm by a new double-paned 

unit can be as much as forty years. Since the 

average owner stays in the same house around 

seven years, that person would not ever gain 

the benefit of replacement. Furthermore, the 

average replacement window will fail within 20 

years and have to be replaced again. 

Replacement Windows are Guaranteed 

Many companies promise that their products 

will save you up to 40% in energy costs by 

installing their new windows. However, the 

fine print in their guarantee may say that if you 

don’t reach that goal, they will only refund you 

$500 after you have spent thousands of dollars 

for the replacements. 

Also many replacements come with “limited 

lifetime warranties.” It is wise to read these 

warranties because they are limited. Most 

components, glass and installation have limits 

in years and are not warranted for a lifetime 

(yours or your house). Also there may be other 

restrictions including how transferable they are 

to new owners. Check the fine print. 

Are Replacement Windows the 

Environmentally-Responsible Choice? 

Going green is much more than just energy 

performance. In this case, one must take 

into account the embedded energy already 

expended in the materials, assembly and 

installation of the existing windows as well 

as their extended life-cycle since they can 

be repaired. Consider the energy lost when 

these original windows are discarded and 

the energy required to acquire the materials, 

manufacture, transport, and install the new 

units. More importantly, consider the life-cycle 

of these new units and how they will have to be 

completely replaced in another twenty years 

or so. 4 REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 4.14 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

width of the original openings. 

15. Retain the appearance of a double-hung window 

whether one or both sashes are operable. 

16. Do not reduce the glass surface area. 

17. Maintain the original number and arrangement 

of panes. For Mid-Century Modern Houses in 

Oaklawn, the original configuration is typically a 

horizontal two-pane sash and frame. 

18. Give depth and profile to windows by using 

true divided lights, or three-part simulated 

divided lights with integral spacer bars and 

both interior and exterior fixed muntins. Small 

variations such as the width and depth of the 

muntins and sash may be permitted if those 

variations do not significantly impact the historic 

characteristics of the window design. Clip-in/false 

muntins, flat muntins and removable 

external grilles are not allowed. 

19. Replace a wood window with a wood window 

when possible. Aluminum-clad wood that meet 

these Standards may be considered on a case-

by-case basis. Requests for vinyl windows, wood-

resin composite, or fiberglass windows must be 

reviewed by the full Historic District Commission. 

20. Use translucent glass. 

21. Paint windows in a historically appropriate paint 

color, if possible. 

22. If a residentially-designed building is being 

converted (or has been converted) to commercial 

uses, the residential styled windows should be 

retained. If they are too deteriorated to preserve, 

the new replacement should meet the Standards 

as described above. While porches may be 

enclosed for commercial uses by following the 

porch Standards, the façade windows of the 

dwelling should not be replaced with single sheets 

of glass for display. 

STANDARDS 

For Existing Windows: 

1. Retain and preserve windows that contribute 

to the overall historic character of a building, 

including frames, sash, glass, muntins, sills, trim, 

surrounds, and shutters. Ensure that all hardware 

is in good operating condition. 

2. Repair original windows by patching, splicing, 

consolidating, or otherwise reinforcing. Wood that 

appears to be in bad condition because of peeling 

paint or separated joints often can, in fact, be 

repaired rather than replaced. Ensure that caulk 

and glazing putty are in good condition and that 

water drains off the sills. 

3. Replace only those features of the window that are 

beyond repair. 

4. Uncover and repair covered-up windows and 

reinstall windows with their original dimensions 

where they have been blocked in. 

5. If a window is no longer needed due to interior 

renovations, retain the glass screen or shutter the 

backside so that it appears from the outside to be 

in use. 

6. Avoid adding new openings or changing existing 

openings on primary elevations. 

7. Reconstruct missing windows based on old 

photographs, drawings, and existing windows in 

the house. 

8. If a window on the front of the house is missing 

or beyond repair and full replacement is required, 

consider relocating a matching original window 

from a secondary elevation. The window should be 

the same style and size as identified on the front 

elevation. Install a new window on the secondary 

façade to match size and features of the original. 

9. Exterior storm windows should meet the following 

criteria: 

a. Match divisions to sash lines of the original 

windows. Use meeting rails only in 

conjunction with double-hung windows and 

place them in the same relative location as 

the primary sash. 

b. Size exterior storm windows to fit tightly 

within the inside casing of the existing 

window openings without the need for a 

subframe or panning (a filler panel) around the 

perimeter. 

c. Match the color of the frame with the color of 

the primary window frame. 

d. Use only clear glass. 

e. Set storm sash as far back from the plane of 

the exterior wall surface as practicable. 

For Replacement Windows: Applicants seeking 

the total replacement of original historic windows, 

as defined in B-1, will be referred to the HDC for 

review. 

10. Replace entire windows only when they are 

missing or beyond repair. 

11. To determine if replacement windows are 

necessary, first survey existing window conditions 

by noting the number of windows, whether each 

window is original or replaced, the material, type, 

hardware and finish, the condition of the frame, 

sash, sill, putty, and panes, in order to clearly 

gauge the extent of rehabilitation or replacement 

necessary. See Section on Energy Conservation 

at the beginning of this chapter. 

12. If only the original sashes are badly deteriorated, 

explore using sash replacement kits and retain 

existing wood window frames. This approach 

reduces potential damage to the surrounding 

interior and exterior historic materials. 

13. Maintain the original size and shape of windows. 

Thin sash frames rarely maintain the overall 

appearance of historic sash. 

14. Match window replacements to the height and REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 44.15 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

SHUTTERS 

Shutters originally functioned as a means to control 

the amount of light and air entering a building, 

as well as providing privacy and protection from 

the elements. Operational shutters can work with 

double-hung sash windows to provide you with 

a variety of options for controlling the interior 

temperature of your home without air conditioning. 

STANDARDS 

For Shutters: 

1. Retain any original shutters and hardware. 

2. Repair existing historic wood shutters following 

the Standards. 

3. Replace shutters that are beyond repair to match 

the size and design of the original shutter. 

4. New shutters should be constructed of wood or a 

composite material without a faux wood grain that 

retains the characteristics of wood and is able to 

be sawn and painted. Vinyl and aluminum shutters 

are not appropriate. 

5. New shutters should be sized to fit the window 

opening and result in the covering of the window 

opening when closed. 

6. Shutters should be mounted on hinges. When 

required, replace original hardware with non-

rusting metal in the same design. 

7. Shutters on multiple or bay windows are not 

appropriate. 

8. Do not nail, screw, or permanently secure original 

shutters open and eliminate its hardware. 

9. Buildings that historically never had shutters 

should remain that way. 

10. The design of new shutters should be 

architecturally consistent with the building’s style. 

Triple windows typically were not designed to have shutters. 

There are 

several designs 

of shutters 

including, 

decorative, 

louvered, and 

paneled. (Top 

to bottom) 

These shutters are properly sized for the window and 

hung on hinges. When closed the shutters fit the 

window opening. 

11. Despite being wood, barn-style and pallet-style 

shutters are not architecturally consistent with any 

building in Charlotte’s Local Historic Districts and 

should not be installed. 

12. Mid-Century Modern shutters generally are 

decorative, not operable, attached to the wall 

and may not fit the opening. Often their panel 

patterns match the window divisions. Retain such 

examples and repair or replace with matching 

ones if too deteriorated to retain. 

These Mid-Century Modern shutters have a distinctive 

design of four panels that align with the window divisions. 4 REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 4.16 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

LIGHT FIXTURES 

Also addressed under Private Site Standards, 

exterior lighting can be a character-defining feature 

on historic homes in Charlotte’s historic districts. 

These lights may be sconces on porch columns or 

on walls flanking entrances, fixtures on ceilings of 

porches, or a lamppost at the edge of a sidewalk. 

They may be made of metal or wood and have 

decorative features. Retain and repair historic light 

fixtures as needed. 

STANDARDS 

For Light Fixtures: 

1. Maintain existing historic light fixtures and repair 

or rebuild as necessary. 

2. Replace missing fixtures with new fixtures of a 

style and scale appropriate to the architecture and 

period of the house. 

This side-mounted entry light in a Craftsman style relates 

to the door design. 

This central mounted light is in a typical location over the 

arched entry. 

Many Colonial Revival residences have pairs of entry 

lanterns, located next to each side of the portico. 

This lantern is suspended from the underside of the 

projecting entry gable feature. REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 44.17 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

Materials 

1. Current fabric types of dyed acrylics and 

acrylic-coated, poly-cotton blends are the most 

appropriate type of awing materials on historic 

buildings. 

2. Metal-aluminum and fiberglass awnings may be 

more appropriate on existing mid-century modern 

residential styles. 

3. Non-historic commercial buildings or modified 

storefronts may use fabric awnings or 

combinations of metal, glass or fabrics for a more 

contemporary design statement. 

Design & Placement 

4. Place awnings carefully within the storefront, 

porch, door, or window openings so that they do 

not obscure elements or damage materials. 

5. Choose designs that do not interfere with existing 

signs, distinctive architectural features of the 

building, street trees, or other elements along the 

street. 

6. Choose an awning shape that fits the opening in 

which it is installed. 

7. Make sure the bottom of the awning valance 

meets code requirements. 

8. Awning fabrics and colors should complement the 

architecture of the house. 

NOTE: Avoid shiny plastic-like materials on awnings 

in the historic districts and avoid back-lit awnings 

that create a glowing effect. Any signage should 

be placed on the valance of the awning not on the 

sloped surface. 

AWNINGS 

Commercial Awnings 

Awnings were originally developed in classical 

times to provide shade for arena events and covers 

for market stalls. They were made from a canvas 

fabric (closely woven cotton). In the 19th century, 

they became popular to shield storefronts as the 

evolution of glass allowed larger display areas. The 

commercial application of awnings has multiple 

functions: It blocks the sun to reduce heat gain, 

protects products displayed in windows, shields 

customers and other pedestrians passing by the 

business, and adds a colorful element to attract 

more customers. 

Residential Awnings 

Awnings are unique to the Mid-Century Modern 

neighborhood of Oaklawn Park and not typical 

of other historic districts in Charlotte. Due to 

the era of construction, most of the awnings are 

made of metal. Their installation helps control the 

sunlight into windows and provide protection over 

entrances. They are necessary on south-facing 

houses since there are few large trees to provide 

cover on the open front lawns of this district. 

STANDARDS 

Various dwellings in Oaklawn Park use metal awnings to 

shield all their south facing windows and entry from the 

effects of the sun. 

The use of awnings over storefronts shield the interiors 

from sun and heat gain. 4 REHABILITATION OF BUILDING ELEMENTS 4.18 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

STOREFRONTS 

The storefront is one of the significant sections of 

a typical facade of a historic commercial building 

and the most visible since it is located on the main 

(pedestrian) level of the structure. Its transparent 

windows were designed to draw the customer or 

client to the business within as well as to display the 

merchandise sold there. At night, the lit storefront 

helps illuminate the sidewalk and add visual 

interest to passing pedestrians. There is usually 

some sort of cornice above the storefront and a 

sign band may be incorporated into the design. 

Charlotte’s historic districts have several types of 

storefronts including historic commercial buildings 

as described above, houses that have been 

converted into commercial uses and industrial 

type structures that have been adapted to new 

commercial uses. 

1. Preserve elements, materials, and features that 

are original to the building or are early remodeling 

projects that may have become significant in 

their own right; repair them as necessary. These 

elements may include character-defining features 

such as cornices, windows and trim, storefront 

windows, doors, and bulkheads. They may also 

include glass butt window joints and molded clips, 

bronze window strips, and bronze moldings found 

on period storefront systems. Also retain historic 

hardware such as hinges and door handles. 

2. Remove any non-historic, inappropriate elements, 

materials, signs, or canopies that were added 

later and obscure original architectural elements. 

Covering up windows, cornices, decorative 

features, or significant portions of the wall 

alters the building’s proportions and changes its 

appearance; these alterations should be removed. 

STANDARDS 

3. If significant storefront features are uncovered 

in any careful exploratory demolition, assess 

their condition for preserving, repairing, or 

reconstructing them. 

4. Reconstruct missing elements (such as cornices, 

window frames, transoms, and bulkheads) 

with physical evidence and/or historic photos 

if available. Otherwise, design simplified new 

elements that respect the character, materials, 

and design of the building. 

5. Avoid using or retaining materials and elements 

that are incompatible with the building or district. 

Depending on the style and age of the commercial 

building, these may include: unpainted aluminum-

frame windows and doors, unpainted aluminum 

panels or display framing, reflective or tinted glass 

display windows, T1-11, vinyl or aluminum siding, 

EFIS (artificial stucco), wood shingles, mansard 

roofs, metal awnings, coach lanterns, residential 

styled solid doors, plastic shutters, inoperable 

shutters, or shutters on windows where they 

never previously existed. Creating false historical 

appearances like Colonial, Old English, or other 

themed storefront designs are not appropriate 

for the authentic historic buildings in Charlotte’s 

historic districts. 

6. Do not remove or reduce the size of storefront 

windows in order to create privacy for the use of 

the building such as an office occupant. Partial 

interior shutters, blinds, curtains or frosted scrim 

patterns can block views without destroying the 

significant storefront window. 

7. Do not remove or cover up original storefront 

elements such as cornices or transom windows 

to create a space for a sign or because of an 

installation of a dropped ceiling in the building’s 

interior. If the transom glass has been removed, 

this area can be used for a sign installation or 

for an awning, depending on the overall existing 

design and proportions of the façade. 

8. Do not remove non-original storefronts that may 

have become historically significant alterations 

within the history of the building. An example 

would be a complete storefront replacement from 

the early 20th century that retained its design 

integrity. It is now an important historic and early 

change that should be preserved. 

9. When residential structures are converted to 

commercial uses, original design features such 

as front porches, and original façade windows 

should be retained. Porches may be enclosed with 

glass panels inserted as to keep the original porch 

features intact as much as possible. 

10. Industrial buildings that have garage openings and 

are being converted to commercial uses may be 

adapted to more transparent designs by installing 

new garage doors with more glass or by designing 

a new storefront within the garage opening. 

Storefronts can 

have a variety of 

configurations 

including recessed (1); 

angled recessed (2) and 

entrance and display 

windows separated (3).

This section includes information on the type, maintenance, and repair of materials 

found on houses in Charlotte’s historic districts. Like most historic areas, Charlotte’s 

neighborhoods have a very wide variety of materials used for foundations, siding, 

roofs, and details. Many historic materials have a long life if they are properly 

maintained. Moisture is the most frequent cause of deterioration for many materials. 

Guidance on replacement materials is also provided in this chapter. However, 

it is important to note that substitute materials are generally not allowed when 

rehabilitating historic buildings in Charlotte’s historic districts. Information on 

substitute materials for new construction can be found in this document under 

Standards for New Construction. 5 BUILDING MATERIALS 5.2 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

WOOD 

The availability and flexibility of wood has made 

it the most common building material throughout 

much of America’s history. Because it can be 

shaped easily by sawing, planing, and carving, 

wood is used for a broad range of elements 

including cornices, brackets, shutters, posts and 

columns, railings, doors, windows, and trim. 

In addition, wood is used in major elements, such 

as framing, siding, and shingles. The main objective 

is to keep wood free from water damage, rot, and 

wood-boring pests. Properly maintained wood can 

last decades and even centuries. 

STANDARDS 

For Wood: 

1. Retain wood as one of the dominant framing, 

cladding, and decorative materials. 

2. Retain wood features that define the overall 

character of the building. 

3. Repair rotted or missing sections rather than 

replace the entire element. 

4. Use new or salvaged wood, epoxy consolidants, or 

fillers to patch, piece, or consolidate parts. 

5. New wood components (siding, trim, columns, 

etc.) should not have visible knots and markings 

once painted. 

6. Match existing historic materials and details. 

7. Replace wood elements only when they are 

rotted beyond repair. Do not use cementitious, 

vinyl, aluminum, composite, engineered wood, or 

fiberglass siding to replace original irreparable 

wood siding. 

8. Match the original in material and design or use 

surviving material. Wood is used extensively for siding and trim (top), trim 

on masonry buildings (center), and shingle siding (bot -

tom). The wide variety of size and detail is dependant 

on the style of the building. 

9. Base the design of reconstructed wood elements 

on pictorial or physical evidence from historic 

sources. 

10. Do not use synthetic siding, such as vinyl or 

aluminum to cover existing wood. 

11. Do not use high-pressure power washing to clean 

wood siding as the pressure may force moisture 

behind the siding where it can lead to paint failure 

and rot. 

12. Do not caulk under individual siding boards or 

windowsills as this action may seal the building too 

tightly and can lead to moisture problems within 

the frame walls and cause paint failure. 

Since most of the Mid-Century Modern examples locally 

are brick, the use of wood is limited to the eaves, siding 

in gable ends, windows with their frames, and doors.

STUCCO 

Stucco is a type of exterior plaster. It may be 

applied directly over masonry or applied over 

wood or metal lath on a wood structure. Stucco can 

be finished in numerous surface textures dictated 

by the style of the building including smooth, 

roughcast, sponged, and scored. 

While stucco is considered a protective coating, it 

is highly susceptible to water damage, particularly 

if the structure underneath the stucco is damaged. 

Historic stucco needs regular maintenance in order 

to keep it in good condition. 

If stucco is the primary wall cladding, the materials 

under the stucco were not intended to show, so 

complete removal of stucco in these instances is 

considered inappropriate. A stucco surface may 

have also been applied to a building at a later date. 

As a secondary material, it may have acquired 

its own significance over time and in many cases 

should also be retained. 

STANDARDS 

For stucco: 

1. Maintain historic stucco. It is a character-defining 

material that has acquired significance over time. 

Do not remove historic stucco coatings from brick 

or stone. 

2. Use a replacement stucco mix that is weaker than 

the masonry to which it is being applied and which 

replicates the visual qualities of the historic stucco. 

3. Repair any water damage to the underlying 

structure to provide a sound base for necessary 

stucco repairs. 

4. Repair stucco or plastering by removing loose 

material and patching with a new material that is 

similar in strength, composition, color, and texture. 

Do not use commercial caulks or other compounds 

to patch the stucco. Because of the difference in 

consistency and texture, repairs made with caulk 

will be highly visible and may cause more damage. 

5. Use a professional plasterer for stucco repair. A 

qualified tradesperson will assess the damage 

and perform an analysis to match the new stucco 

composition to the existing material. 

6. Stucco may be tinted or pigmented and 

sometimes was whitewashed or color-washed. 

When replacing or repairing stucco, match the 

color or tint of the existing material. 

7. After repairs have been made, stucco buildings 

may require repainting. Consult a professional to 

determine the appropriate compatible paint for 

the existing surface coating. 

8. Replace stucco completely if more than half of the 

surface area has lost its bond with the substrate. 

9. Clean a stucco building using the most gentle 

means possible, preferably a low-pressure water 

wash and soft bristle brush. Take care not to 

damage the surface texture. 

National Park Service Preservation Brief #22: The 

Preservation and Repair of Historic Stucco

MASONRY 

Historic masonry has been used for centuries 

and is one of the most durable building materials 

available. It may include brick, stone, terra cotta, 

concrete, stucco, tile, and mortar. 

Most masonry problems can be avoided with 

monitoring and prevention. Disintegrating 

mortar, cracks in mortar joints, loose bricks, 

or damaged plaster work may signal the need 

for masonry repair. 

Brick masonry is used for walls on Colonial Revival 

houses (top) and other revival styles (center). Stone is 

used as a highlight around doors (center) and as a sec -

tion of the facade (bottom) as seen in the Mid-Century 

Modern Example.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION 

STANDARDS 

For Masonry: 

1. To maintain masonry in a sound condition, prevent 

water from gathering at the base of a wall by 

ensuring that the ground slopes away. Repair any 

leaking roofs, gutters, downspouts, and secure 

loose flashing. 

2. Retain masonry features that are important in 

defining the overall character of the building. 

3. Leave unpainted masonry unpainted. 

4. Repair or replace a masonry feature only when 

necessary, using masonry that respects the size, 

texture, color, and pattern of the historic material, 

as well as mortar joint size and tooling. 

5. Repair cracks and unsound mortar with mortar 

and masonry that matches the historic material. 

Ensure that cracks do not indicate structural 

settling or deterioration. Sound mortar should be 

left intact. 

6. Cleaning masonry should only be undertaken to 

remove heavy paint buildup, halt deterioration 

or to remove heavy soiling. The best method for 

cleaning unpainted brick is to use a low-pressure 

wash of no more than 200 psi, equivalent to the 

pressure in a garden hose. A mild detergent may 

be added when necessary. 

To remove paint from masonry, chemically clean 

with an appropriate cleanser and low pressure 

wash. Test any detergent or chemical cleaner on 

a small, inconspicuous part of the building first. 

Older brick may be too soft to clean and can be 

damaged either by chemicals or by the pressure 

of the water. (This test is a mandatory step if you 

are applying for federal or state rehabilitation 

tax credits.) Do not sandblast or use high-

pressure water-blasting as these methods can 

do irreparable damage to masonry. Follow any 

environmental regulations when undertaking 

such cleaning. 5 BUILDING MATERIALS 5.6 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

b. Old mortar joints should be duplicated in 

width and profile (see the Mortar Joint Profile 

illustration). It is also possible to match the 

color of the new mortar to a cleaned section 

of existing mortar. 

c. New mortar should not be stronger than 

the original mortar. Brick walls expand and 

contract with freezing and heating conditions, 

and old mortar moves to relieve the stress. If 

a hard portland cement mortar is used, the 

mortar will not flex as much, and the brick can 

crack, break, or spall. 

d. Mortar of older brick buildings can be tested 

to determine the mix. Much old mortar has 

a higher lime and sand content. New mortar 

has more portland cement. Testing can 

determine the appropriate mortar mix and 

color if necessary. 

STANDARDS 

7. Avoid waterproofing, water-repellent, or non-

historic coatings on masonry unless moisture 

is able to “breathe” through the coating. An 

anti-graffiti coating may be used on masonry 

areas if needed. 

8. Repointing masonry requires professionals 

experienced in working with historic masonry. 

The following are Standards for repointing: 

a. Deteriorated mortar should be removed by 

hand-raking the joints to avoid damage to the 

brick or the surrounding area. Roughly one 

inch of old mortar should be removed to allow 

for the new mortar. Do not remove mortar 

with electric saws or hammers that damage 

the surrounding masonry. 

Brick Concave Brick Struck Brick Weathered Brick Flush 

TYPICAL MORTAR JOINT PROFILES 

For Masonry (continued): 

e. Avoid using synthetic caulking compound or 

portland cement as a substitute for mortar. 

f. Do not undertake “scrub” coating, in which 

a thinned, low-aggregate coat of mortar is 

brushed over the entire masonry surface and 

then scrubbed off the bricks after drying as a 

substitute for traditional repointing. 

g. Avoid parging or covering of brick or block 

with a coating of mortar to create a stucco 

appearance on the primary elevation of a 

building or where it will have a detrimental 

effect on the performance of the material. 

If a masonry foundation has deteriorated, 

the cause of the deterioration needs to be 

identified and corrected instead of parging 

over it. 

h. The need to correct damage caused by the 

use of improper cleaning techniques will not 

obligate the Historic District Commission to 

approve correction methods that otherwise 

violate HDC policy BUILDING MATERIALS 55.7 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

METAL 

In Charlotte’s historic districts, metal is used 

for features such as roofs, railings, hardware, 

decorative features, and some fences. Mid-Century 

Modern houses use decorative metal for porch 

columns and railings. Original historic metal 

features should be retained and restored, or if 

beyond repair, replaced with in-kind materials 

as needed. 

STANDARDS 

For Metal: 

1. Use the gentlest means possible when 

cleaning metals. 

2. Prepare for repainting by hand-scraping or 

brushing with natural bristle brushes to remove 

loose and peeling paint. Removing paint down 

to the bare metal is not necessary, but removal 

of all corrosion is essential. 

3. Clean cast iron and iron alloys (hard metals) with a 

low-pressure, dry-grit blasting (80-100 pounds per 

square inch) if gentle means do not remove old 

paint properly. Protect adjacent wood or masonry 

surfaces from the grit. 

4. Some metals such as steel and copper are 

incompatible and should not be placed together 

without a separation material such as nonporous, 

neoprene gaskets or butyl rubber caulking. 

Metal railings are one of the most common uses of 

this material within the districts. 

Metal windows, often casement types, are found rarely in 

the district and should be retained. 

Some smaller vernacular houses have porches sup -

ported by decorative metal columns 

Decorative cast aluminum elements like these porch 

supports, railings, and storm door are typical metal 

elements in Mid-Century Modern buildings. 5 BUILDING MATERIALS 5.8 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

3. If paint is failing due to moisture, identify sources 

of moisture problems, and take appropriate 

measures to fix them. 

a. Remove vegetation that grows too closely to 

wood and take any other steps necessary to 

ensure the free circulation of air near wood 

building elements. 

b. Repair leaking roofs, gutters, downspouts, 

and flashing. 

c. Maintain proper drainage around the 

foundation to prevent standing water 

4. Performed by a contractor experienced in 

working on historic buildings, professional 

chemical removal of paint may be acceptable in 

certain situations. Sandblasting, open flames, or 

high-pressure water wash to remove paint from 

masonry, soft metal, or wood is not allowed. All 

paint removal requires adherence to lead paint 

abatement requirements. 

5. Re-caulk joints where moisture might penetrate a 

building before repainting. 

6. Paint unpainted aluminum-frame storm windows 

and doors to match wood trim. 

7. Do not paint masonry that is unpainted. 

8. Do not completely remove paint to achieve a 

natural finish on wood components. 

9. A paint color scheme can be chosen that is 

appropriate to the time period in which a building 

was constructed and that is generally compatible 

with adjacent structures. A basic approach to color 

placement is to paint similar elements with the 

same color to achieve a unified rather than overly 

busy and disjointed appearance. For instance, 

select wall and trim colors and consider the use 

of an accent color on features such as shingles, 

window sash, shutters, and doors depending on 

the style of the building. 

PAINT 

A properly painted building accentuates its 

character-defining details and protects the 

building from deterioration. While paint color 

is not regulated, the hue and placement of 

color can complement the architectural style 

of a building. Painting brick or masonry is not 

considered a change of color, but a fundamental 

change in the character of a building and is 

typically not allowed. Painting may be considered 

if documentation shows it will unify disparate parts 

of the building, provided the disparate work is not 

of one’s own doing. 

STANDARDS 

Standards for Paint: 

1. Maintain painted surfaces, keeping the painted 

surface sound. If paint is peeling, remove peeling 

paint, prime, and repaint with compatible primer 

and finish coat. Liquid vinyl coatings are not 

allowed. 

2. Foundations should be visually differentiated from 

the main body of the structure. 

This house is a good example of how to place color by keeping the scheme simple and

Standards for Murals: 

1. The design and installation of a mural should 

complement and enhance the building or wall and 

be incorporated within the overall architectural

6. Murals on unpainted non-historic buildings or walls 

will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 

7. Mural designs should not contain any advertising 

including company names, business logos, and/or 

symbols that are related to the business within the

the types of priming and the paints and protective 

coatings to be used. Also, if a panel is used, its 

material and texture, attachment, and moisture 

effects on the historic wall should be addressed. 

Written explanation of the wall surface and 

cladding, its suitability to receive the proposed 

materials, and the potential impact to historic 

materials, where relevant, shall be provided. All 

mural(s) shall have a wall surface suitable to receive

6.1 

# NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 6

Charlotte’s historic districts are largely built out, but occasionally there are proposals 

for new construction of residences or multi-family buildings either within or on the 

edges of a particular historic district. This chapter provides guidance for both of 

those conditions and building types. The goal for creating a new building within a 

historic district should be to fit in and not stand out. The design of a new home or 

multi-family building should respect and not compete with its historic neighbors 

because preservation of the distinctive character of the district is the overarching 

goal. 

This approach does not mean that all new construction in the historic districts 

should copy existing historic buildings. The scale, mass, and size of a building 

defines its relationship to surrounding historic structures more than the decorative 

details applied. However, well designed stylistic and decorative elements, as well as 

building materials and landscaping, can give new construction projects the attributes 

necessary to blend in with the district while creating a distinctive character for the 

new building. Therefore, the Charlotte Historic District Commission does not specify 

a particular architectural style or design for new construction projects, but the criteria 

in this chapter are all important when considering whether a proposed new building 

design is appropriate, compatible, and not incongruous to the historic district. 

The zoning along the edges of some areas of these historic districts may allow for 

more variety of building uses than found elsewhere in the district. The HDC does not 

have purview over building uses allowed by zoning; however, regardless of use, the 

design of new buildings needs to fit within the historic context. To minimize impact 

on neighboring historic dwellings, the HDC will require scale-reducing techniques 

for all new infill construction. Designing these structures to minimize their impact on 

neighboring historic dwellings is a challenging exercise. Scale-reducing techniques 

such as dividing the elevation elements into smaller bays, stepping back taller levels 

of the new building next to smaller historic structures, varying building planes, 

breaking up roof masses, using multiple materials, and taking clues from nearby 

historic buildings are essential to reducing the negative visual impact of these larger 

structures on the historic districts. 6 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 6.2 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

CONTEXT 

The context of a particular site is composed of 

the overall physical character and individual 

elements of the entire surrounding area. As such, 

the block and the surrounding historic structures 

in which the new site is located should be carefully 

studied when designing a new infill dwelling. 

Typically, the new construction of single family 

structures is less impactful to the overall 

character of a district and its immediate context 

than the new construction of multi-family or 

commercial structures. For proposed new single 

family structures, the context is defined as a 

360-degree view from the sidewalk in front of the 

subject parcel. For proposed new multi-family 

construction, context is defined as a 360-degree 

view from the center of the parcel(s), as new multi-

family structures will likely have a greater impact to 

all surrounding structures. 

This context can be divided into three parts: 

W The Public Realm: This area includes all 

of the public areas of the block including 

the street, planting strip, sidewalks, and 

curbs as well as appurtenances such as 

streetlights and various utility elements. 

Street trees and plantings may be a part of 

this area as well. The arrangement, scale, 

and materials of elements in this realm 

define its context. 

W The Semi Public/Private Realm: This area 

includes the parts of the private sites that 

can be viewed from a public right-of-way 

including the existing building on the site. 

In most instances the context may include 

the front lawn, steps, walks, driveway, any 

walls or fences, trees and other plantings, 

lighting, and open areas of any of the

dwelling’s porches or balconies. Just as 

important to these viewable site features 

is the positioning of the building itself. 

The structure’s setback and spacing in 

relation to neighboring buildings define 

the character of its location. The scale, 

height and width, orientation, massing and 

complexity of form, directional expression, 

and individual elements, details, rhythm, 

and materials all come together to define 

the context of the building itself. 

W The Private Realm: This area generally 

includes the interior of the building and 

areas of the site that are not viewable from 

a public right-of-way such as rear lawns, 

outbuildings, or other site features.

For Context: 

1. Non-historic buildings within the historic 

district and in the context of the proposed new 

construction are not considered as context for any 

new construction. 

2. When transitioning from single family to denser 

development areas that by zoning allow larger 

multi-family developments, the historic context 

surrounding the site must be respected in terms 

height, massing, roof forms, materials, etc. 

3. Historic multi-family structures were designed 

to fit into the residential architectural character 

of the historic districts and any new multi-family 

developments in the context of the historic district 

need to do the same. While new multi-family 

buildings can take many design cues from existing 

historic buildings, respecting the immediate 

historic context of the new development is 

essential in terms of height, scale, massing, 

rhythm, roof forms, materials, etc. 

4. Where a site exists with a buildable area for 

more than four multi-family housing units, the 

immediate historic context takes priority in terms 

of height, scale, massing, rhythm, roof forms, 

materials, modulated facades, etc. and must be 

respected. 

5. Aligning foundations, eave lines, window header 

heights, and porch heights with adjacent historic 

buildings is essential with fitting new construction 

in the historic context. 

STANDARDS 

CONTEXT 3D VIEW 

Studying and understanding this context of the 

historic district’s block when designing a new 

infill building within it is an essential part of the 

process. Analyzing this existing historic character 

of the surrounding area of a site for a proposed 

new building should be included with the 

application to the HDC. 6 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 6.4 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

These are views of various context situations for new construction in a historic district. The vacant site slated for new construction (orange areas) must relate to the 

surrounding historic buildings visible from the site. The larger newer (less than 50 years) buildings do not relate to historic dwellings and even though they may be located 

in the historic district, they are not considered a part of the context for new construction. Buildings outside the historic district are not considered context. These buildings 

and areas are indicated with the red “not allowed” symbol in these diagrams. Area inside dotted lines denote locations within historic districts. Examples A, B, and D 

illustrate context for new multi-family structures, as described on page 6.2. Example C illustrates the context of a new single family structure as described on page 6.2.

SETBACK 

Setback is the distance between the front thermal 

wall of the building and the property line or right-

of-way boundary at the front of the lot. 

For Setbacks: 

1. Relate the setback of any new construction and 

additions to the setback of the existing historic 

buildings in the immediate surroundings of the 

proposed new construction. The setback of 

new buildings should also consider the distance 

between a proposed front porch/stoop and the 

property line or right-of-way boundary. 

2. Defer to the setback of the historic buildings for 

sites located between two distinctive areas of 

setback, such as between new commercial and 

traditional residential uses. 

3. The primary elevation(s) of new corner buildings 

should match the setback of adjacent historic 

buildings. 

4. Secondary elevations that are facing side streets 

(typically in corner lots) may allow flexibility with 

setback and potentially be closer to the street. 

However, the historic context of the site and 

buildings on the side street will be taken into 

consideration by the HDC. 

5. Front setbacks of buildings that occur on the edge 

of a district and are facing denser commercial 

non-historic development can have shallower 

setbacks if they do not compromise the portions 

of the project facing the historic district. 

NOTE: Applicants should consult with HDC Staff 

to determine if an individual property is in an area 

where the historic urban development pattern is being 

restored or where the Charlotte Zoning Ordinance may 

be in conflict with this guideline. 

In streets with larger parcels, the 

Colonial Revival and Tudor Revival 

style residences have much larger 

and deeper front setbacks. 

Most setbacks of blocks of Bungalow-

scaled dwellings create shallow front lawns. 

The front and side setbacks of a proposed new building should respect the 

setbacks of the historic buildings in its immediate context.

SPACING 

Spacing refers to the side yard distances 

between buildings. 

For Spacing: 

1. Space new construction according to the historic 

pattern in the immediate surroundings of the 

proposed new construction. This includes sites 

adjacent to, as well as, across the street from the 

proposed new construction. 

2. New multi-family buildings should respect 

historic lot lines and parcel sizes. For multi-family 

buildings that are more than one lot width on 

the primary elevation and street, the mass of the 

building should be modulated with a material 

change and/or architectural change that creates a 

break in the wall plane to emulate the spacing of 

existing historic buildings. 

3. The front door(s) that connects the building to the 

sidewalk is a key feature of new infill construction 

to help maintain the rhythm, modulation, and 

spacing patterns of the street. Front entrances 

must be incorporated on all street-facing 

elevations for new construction. On multi-family 

buildings, multiple entrances may be required. 

Larger lots translate 

into larger spacing 

between houses. 

Smaller lots have smaller side 

yards on many streets with 

Bungalow designs. 

Modulating the mass of a new multi-family building should emulate the spacing of the surrounding single-family 

historic dwellings.

STANDARDS NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 66.7 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

ORIENTATION 

Orientation refers to the direction in which the front 

of the building faces. 

For Orientation: 

1. Orient the front entrance of new houses to 

the street. 

2. Orient the primary elevation to the primary street 

and address the secondary side street through 

the uses of porches, side entries and other 

architectural elements, if the building is to be 

constructed on a corner lot. 

3. With courtyard type developments, the 

streetfront units should be oriented to the street, 

like existing houses in context, along with the 

courtyard oriented to the street with interior/rear 

unit entrances facing the courtyard. 

Regardless of the size of the lot, both small and 

large scale parcels have residential designs 

oriented to the street. 

A new courtyard development can have units facing in to the middle of the lot but 

streetfront units should be oriented to the street like existing historic houses in the 

context of the development

STANDARDS 6 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 6.8 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

MASSING AND COMPLEXITY OF FORM 

The overall massing of a building relates to the 

organization and relative size of the building 

sections, or parts of a building, in relationship 

to each other and other buildings on the 

street. A building’s form, or mass, can be 

simple (a box) or complex (a combination of 

many boxes or projections and indentations). 

For Massing and Form: 

1. Relate massing to those of existing adjacent historic 

houses. For instance, if a street is primarily Colonial 

Revival style houses with simple massing, do not 

introduce a new building with a complex massing. 

2. Use forms for new construction that relate to the 

forms of the majority of surrounding buildings. 

For instance, if the form of adjacent buildings has 

a variety of projecting bays, dormers, etc., employ 

some of these elements in the new building. 

3. The massing of historic multi-family buildings, 

typically duplexes and fourplexes in Charlotte, have 

similar massing as single-family dwellings in the 

districts. 

4. Multi-family developments with more than four units 

will need to employ techniques for breaking down 

the mass and modulating the facades to appear 

as separate structures in order to have the new 

development fit the scale of the existing historic 

context. 

5. Roof forms such as hipped and gable roofs help to 

break down the mass as do the complexity of form, 

architectural details, and materials. 

6. New buildings should include scale-reducing 

techniques when the site adjoins historic dwellings. 

Examples include, but are not limited to, dividing 

the elevation elements into smaller bays, stepping 

back taller levels of the new building next to smaller 

historic structures, varying building planes, breaking 

up roof masses, using multiple materials, and taking 

cues from nearby historic buildings. 

This illustration shows examples of mass and form found in Charlotte’s historic districts. The mass and form of the 

Colonial Revival house on the left is simple. The form of the Bungalow in the middle is also simple, but the form is 

slightly more complex with the carved out porch. The Tudor Revival house on the right has a more complex form 

due to the cross gable roof, carved out porch, and large shed dormer making the house appear less massive than 

the Colonial Revival house on the left. 

Massing and form of a larger new 

building should be modulated with 

a break in the wall plane to respect 

the massing and form of the historic 

buildings in its context. 

This new multi-unit development 

successfully breaks down the mass of the 

building to fit the neighborhood context.

HEIGHT AND WIDTH 

The actual size of a new building can either 

contribute to, or be in conflict with, the historic 

structures in a historic district. Height and width 

are two primary considerations for making new 

buildings fit within the context of a historic district. 

For Height and Width: 

1. The height and width of a new building must 

be compatible with historic buildings within a 

360-degree range of visibility of the new building. 

(See Context.) 

2. For new single-family structures, the height of the 

proposed building should be no taller than the 

tallest single-family historic building on the block 

within a 360-degree range of visibility from the 

sidewalk in front of the subject parcel. The height 

of the historic building should be calculated 

from the original historic ridge line (not any later 

additions that may be taller). See illustration C on 

page 6.4, Context. 

3. Design new buildings to respect the existing 

width of original structures in the district. The 

width should be no more than ten percent of the 

average width of other historic buildings within 

the subject block. Larger apartment buildings 

or newer dwellings that do not have historic 

significance should not be included within this 

calculation. 

4. Typically in Charlotte’s historic districts, historic 

duplexes and fourplexes have similar height and 

width as single-family homes and help create the 

historic context. 

5. For new multi-family buildings in the context of 

a historic residential neighborhood, the height 

and width of the houses in their proximity should 

be respected. Context is a 360-degree range 

of visibility from the center of the parcel(s). See 

illustrations A, B and D on page 6.4, Context. 

Foundation heights, porch heights, window header heights, as well as the overall height of buildings in the context of the new building must be considered in the height and 

width design of new construction. 

STANDARDS 

The Fourth Ward Historic District already has a 

large amount of new, non-historic, multi-family 

developments that range from townhomes to 

multi-story apartment buildings. New multi-

family development in this district that is not in 

the context of the historic two-story residential 

types can have more flexibility in height and 

width. Note that the HDC reviews only the first 

3-5 stories of projects in this district. 6 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 6.10 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

SCALE 

Scale in architecture is the relationship of the 

human form to the building. Height and width are 

the beginnings of creating scale; however, other 

elements such as cornices, porches, windows, etc. 

further define scale. Scale is also the relationship of 

the building to buildings around it. 

For Scale: 

1. Create human scale by including functional 

elements typical to the historic context, such as 

porches and porticos. 

Porches and entry features help create scale in the design of any new dwelling. 

Likewise, the use of various materials with their different textures and colors helps break 

down the scale of a design. 

This illustrates how (from left to right) features such as windows and doors, foundation articulation, porches, materials, and window detail create scale that relates a 

building to the human form. 

2. Materials can also break down the mass of a 

building and reinforce human scale. 

3. Care should be taken to design larger scaled 

structures on the edges of the districts, e.g. where 

residential streets meet corridors with different 

zoning. In these instances, the new building 

should use scale reduction techniques (massing, 

height, roof forms, materials, fenestration, etc.) on 

elevations that face historic dwellings. 

4. Use scale-reduction techniques on larger multi-

family structures (massing, height, roof forms, 

elements, materials, fenestration, etc.) particularly 

on elevations that face historic dwellings. These 

situations may occur in areas where the new 

construction faces both the historic district and 

non-historic district areas or where residential 

zoning adjoins commercial or multi-family zoning. 

STANDARDS NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 66.11 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

DIRECTIONAL EXPRESSION 

The relationship of the height and width of the front 

elevation of a building mass provides its directional 

expression. A building may be horizontal, vertical, 

or square in its proportions. 

STANDARDS 

For Directional Expression: 

1. Make sure that the directional expression 

of new residential buildings is compatible 

with that of surrounding houses in the block. 

If the majority of the existing houses within a 

block is relatively square, the new dwelling 

should have similar proportions. If there is 

more variety in the proportions of existing 

houses on a block, the design of a new dwelling 

may select from those options. 

The directional expression of residential designs can be any of the above proportions and the design of new dwellings should relate to the existing 

historic buildings in the context of the new construction. 

vertical horizontal square horizontal 6 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 6.12 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

FOUNDATIONS 

The foundation forms the base of the building. 

The design of new houses should incorporate 

foundations for aesthetic as well as functional 

reasons. When built on a concrete slab without 

a visible foundation, new buildings may appear 

shorter and out of scale with surrounding 

historic buildings. 

STANDARDS 

For Foundations: 

1. Relate the height of a new foundation to the 

height of foundations on historic buildings found 

within the context of the new building. Avoid 

lowering the grade to achieve greater overall 

height to the new building. 

2. Relate the new foundation’s material treatment to 

that found on historic buildings within the context 

of the new building. For instance, use brick or 

stone on frame buildings. 

Historic residences have some sort of foundation that gives them a visual base 

and helps provide scale and height to the design. 

Victorian and bungalow residences have raised foundations that create a base for the rest of the design. Many mid-century modern houses (right) do not have a foundation that 

differs from the body of the house. NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 66.13 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

ROOF FORM AND MATERIALS 

The form of a roof is an important visual element in 

defining a building and, with materials, helps create 

continuity and rhythm in the historic districts. 

The pitch and orientation of gables and hips are 

important aspects of roofs, and there is a wide 

variety of applications of these particular features. 

Likewise, there are various designs for roof dormers 

that correlate to the particular building style. 

Details such as exposed roof rafters and eave 

brackets help to articulate certain architectural 

styles. 

There is a wide variety of roof forms in the districts that 

relates to the style of the dwelling. These roofs exist well 

together because the setback, spacing, height, scale, 

massing, and porch elements of the various designs are 

similar within many blocks. 

STANDARDS 

For Roof Form and Materials: 

1. Use roof forms, such as gable or hipped, or 

combinations of forms in the design of new 

residential buildings that relate to existing 

surrounding examples. 

2. Consider employing roof dormers if they are 

commonly used in nearby historic houses. The 

style of the dormer should relate to the style of 

the house. 

3. Reflect the pitch and gable orientation of 

surrounding historic buildings in the design of 

a new dwelling. For instance, if the context is 

primarily gable-roofed houses, avoid a shallow 

hipped roof. 

4. Proportionally, the new roof should not 

overwhelm the structure or be out of scale for the 

style of the house. 

5. Use eave design and materials that complement 

those frequently found in the block where the new 

building is being constructed. 

6. Match new roof materials with materials used in 

the context of the new building. 

7. Skylights, solar panels, vents, and other similar 

roof features should be located on less visible 

locations of the roof. 

8. For multi-family buildings in a corner location 

where an additional story may be allowed, the 

roof form and design may help to reduce the scale 

of the building in relation to the other homes 

within its context.

CORNICES AND TRIM 

Historic buildings in Charlotte’s historic districts 

have a variety of applications of cornices and 

decorative trim. These elements are used to 

define eave and cornice lines of roofs, articulate 

areas of openings and siding on walls, create 

porch elements, and define the edge of a wall 

and foundation. 

STANDARDS 

For Trim: 

1. Take cues from historic buildings on the 

appropriate use of trim to articulate the design 

of a new building’s style and elements. 

2. Ensure that the proportion and scale of the 

trim relates to the scale and proportion of trim 

on historic buildings within the context of the 

new building. 

3. The triangular box detail, often referred to as a 

pork chop, should not be used on eave returns. 

Half-timber framing on Tudor Revival 

houses is actually just composed of 

decorative trim boards. 

On many different styles, flat boards with 

simple trim define exterior elements such 

as eaves, corners, and windows. 

Many Bungalows have large decorative 

brackets supporting roof overhangs. 

Craftsman style trim details may include 

corner boards and exposed rafter ends.

DOORS AND WINDOWS 

The size, proportion, rhythms, pattern, and 

articulation of door and window openings help to 

give a building its individual style and character. 

The ratio of solid wall to voids created by openings 

also gives a building its particular style. 

There is a wide variety of style and character of 

these openings within buildings in the historic 

districts. Studying these elements of doors and 

windows of existing buildings, within the context of 

the proposed new design, will help better define 

what might be appropriate treatments for a new 

building. 

STANDARDS 

For Fenestration: Doors and Windows 

1. Relate window and door openings for new 

construction to the historic context in the 

following ways: 

a. the ratio of solids (walls) and voids (windows 

and doors); 

b. the rhythm and placement of window and 

door openings; 

c. the proportion of window and door openings 

(the ratio of width to height); and 

d. the general size of windows and doors. 

2. Respect the traditional design of openings. 

For instance, openings are generally recessed 

on a masonry building, while the element is 

surrounded by raised trim on a frame building. 

New openings that are flush with the rest of the 

wall are not allowed. 

3. Construct doors of wood (preferred material). 

Metal-clad, fiberglass, or metal doors may also 

be considered for side and rear doors on new 

construction on a case-by-case basis. 

4. Use windows with true divided lights or interior 

and exterior fixed muntins with internal spacers to 

reference traditional designs and match the style 

of the building. Flat muntins, exterior removable 

grilles, and grills between glass are not allowed. 

The ratio of muntin to glass should be consistent 

with historic buildings in the context of the new 

construction and appropriate to the style. 

5. Do not use tinted, frosted, or mirrored glass on 

major elevations of the building. Translucent 

or the most clear version of low-e glass may be 

approved. 

6. Use shutters of wood or a composite without a 

faux wood grain (rather than metal or vinyl) scaled 

to fit the window opening. Shutters should be 

mounted on hinges. Do not use shutters on bay, 

double, or ganged windows. 

Paired 6-over-1 double-sash windows are symmetrically 

placed on this Colonial Revival style residence. 

Mid-Century Modern can include doors with glass panes, 

picture windows, and sash with horizontal divisions. 

Large single windows on the first floor are balanced by 

smaller paired second floor windows in this example.

Bungalow-style houses have a variety of crafted 

doors with panels and windows in the upper third

PORCHES 

A porch is the focal point of the facade of most 

historic houses. Because of decoration and 

articulation, these features help to add variety and 

rhythm to each block. 

Porches have traditionally been a social gathering 

point, as well as a transition area, between the 

exterior and interior of a residence. New residential 

buildings can better blend with the historic district 

if a porch is incorporated into the design. 

The local historic districts in Charlotte have a rich 

variety of porch types and styles from which design 

cues may be taken. 

STANDARDS 

Porches, porticos, and other entry 

features help create scale to these 

houses and are an essential facade 

element in defining the character of 

the historic districts.

The components of a porch will depend upon the style of the new construction. Typical components are shown 

here. Proper proportions, reveals, and dimensions are required for new construction. 

For Porches: 

1. Include a porch in the design of new residential 

construction when the majority of surrounding existing 

houses also contain a porch. 

2. Design new porches to complement the size, proportion, 

placement, and rhythm of existing historic porches within 

this context. 

3. Ensure that the new porch design and materials are 

compatible with the overall architectural vocabulary/style 

of the new building. Acceptable materials: concrete with 

brick edging, brick, terracotta tile, and tongue & groove. 

Bluestone is not appropriate for new front porches. 

4. Porches typically shall have a minimum depth of 8 feet. 

5. Substitute materials are not allowed for front porch floors. 

Frame porches shall have tongue and groove floors laid 

perpendicular to the front elevation of house. 

6. Mid-Century Modern houses often have a 

small stoop or recessed entry instead of a full 

front porch. Any design for new construction in this setting 

should follow the forms of existing such elements. 

7. For multi-family porches, take cues from existing fourplexes 

and apartment buildings in Charlotte’s historic districts for 

how entrances are treated with porches. Some examples 

have porches on second floors for upper story units. 6 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 6.18 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

MATERIALS 

There is a rich variety of materials used to construct 

the historic buildings in the historic districts 

including wood for trim, windows, doors, siding and 

wall shingles, brick for foundations and walls, stone 

for foundations and porch piers, and stucco for 

walls. The variety of these materials helps give the 

districts rich character. See the Building Materials 

Chapter for more information on materials found in 

Charlotte’s Local Historic Districts. 

In recent years, the building industry has 

developed various substitute materials that have 

a similar appearance to several of these traditional, 

historic materials. For various reasons including 

cost, maintenance, and quality of available original 

materials, substitute materials are being used 

as alternatives to traditional materials in historic 

districts, particularly for compatible 

new construction. 

For Materials: 

1. Use compatible traditional materials such as 

unpainted brick, stucco, stone, and wood for the 

same features as found in the context of the new 

development such as siding, windows, doors, 

trim, and foundations. Avoid split-faced block and 

any material, color, size, scale, or texture that is in 

stark contrast to the historic context. 

2. While wood is the most appropriate material for 

new houses, non-grained cementitious siding 

may be permitted for new construction. Smooth 

cementitious siding that matches the traditional 

dimension (thickness, reveal, etc.) of wood siding 

is permitted for new accessory buildings and 

additions to historic structures. 

3. With the exception of mid-century structures 

that may have been constructed with aluminum 

frame windows, vinyl, PVC, and aluminum frame 

windows and doors, unpainted aluminum panels 

or display framing, reflective or tinted glass 

display windows, particle board/engineered 

wood, T1-11, vinyl or aluminum siding, EFIS 

(artificial stucco), plastic shutters, inoperable 

shutters, or shutters on windows where they never 

previously existed, are not allowed on either 

existing buildings or new construction in the 

historic districts. 

4. While wood is the first choice for elements such 

as trim, porch elements, and other decorative 

features, substitute materials may be considered 

for trim details on new construction. 

5. Metal is used in mid-century style houses for 

decorative features such as porch columns 

and railings. 

6. New brick should be a traditional brick/mortar 

color and should not be painted. Materials for new construction can be derived from 

the existing historic buildings within the proximity 

of the new building. These examples range from 

brick and stucco, to wood siding, wood shingles, 

brick, and stone.

ADDITIONS 

Additions to the existing residential structures 

in Charlotte’s Local Historic Districts should 

complement the original structure. They 

should reflect the design, scale, materials, and 

architectural style of the original building. At the 

same time, a carefully designed new addition may 

respect the original without totally copying the 

historic design features. 

The design of new additions should follow 

the Standards for new construction on the 

preceding pages for all elevations. 

If the homeowner intends to take advantage of 

the available North Carolina historic tax credits 

for the rehabilitation of the existing historic 

house, the design of any new addition will 

require design review at the state level. While these 

Standards follow the intent of the Secretary of the 

Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation projects, 

interpretation of the Standards by the State Historic 

Preservation Office (SHPO) review staff may differ 

from these Standards. 

STANDARDS 

For Additions to Buildings: 

1. Attempt to locate the addition on the rear 

elevation so that it is minimally visible from 

the street. 

2. Limit the size of the addition so that it does not 

visually overpower the existing building. 

3. Attempt to attach new additions or alterations to 

existing buildings in such a manner that, if such 

additions or alterations were to be removed in 

the future, the essential form and integrity of the 

building would be unimpaired. 

4. Maintain the original orientation of the structure. 

If the primary entrance is located on the street 

facade, it should remain in that location. 

5. Maintain the existing roof pitch. Roof lines for 

new additions should be secondary to those of 

the existing structure. Typically, the original roof 

as visible from the public right-of-way should not 

be raised. 

6. Make sure that the design of a new addition is 

compatible with the existing building. The new 

work should be differentiated from the old while 

being compatible with its massing, form, scale, 

directional expression, roof forms and materials, 

foundation, fenestration, and materials. 

7. Additions that are no taller nor wider than the 

existing building and increase the building’s 

square footage 50% or less are typically eligible 

for administrative approval. 

8. In a single family use, no more than 50% of the 

rear yard should be of impermeable material 

including roofs of additions to original buildings, 

paving, decks, patios, pools, and accessory 

buildings. Wood slatted decks are considered 

permeable. 

This one-story rear addition respects the scale, roof 

form, materials and details of the existing house. 

This two-story rear addition, like the example above, 

respects the vocabulary of the original dwelling with 

its hip roof, window proportions, and cladding. 

This is an example of a new front porch and a rear 

addition that is not visible from the street. NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 66.21 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS

Adding a second story to a one-story house compromises the original house and the height overpowers the neighboring residences as well (example A). A rear addition 

has a much less impact on the scale of the street because its location is largely screened by the original house (example B). Example A is not an approvable addition. 

Example B illustrates the type of addition that meets the Standards outlined on the previous page.

# NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS 7

While most of the structures in Charlotte’s historic districts are residential designs, 

there are commercial buildings as well. They include a wide variety of uses such as 

retail, restaurant, office, and service functions. Naturally, they may have different 

building designs and site conditions. Site elements may include parking, signage, 

and lighting. Many of the commercial building’s unique features are found on their 

façades and may include storefronts with display windows, sign-band areas, cornices, 

and special lighting. 

Furthermore, in some locations residential buildings have been converted to 

non-residential uses along some corridors, particularly on East Boulevard. If the 

building was originally a dwelling with a porch, many of these have been enclosed or 

otherwise modified for new commercial uses. 7 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR Non-REsidential BUILDINGS 7.2 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

CONTEXT 

It is very important to evaluate the context for new 

construction, including the character-defining 

features of the historic districts. This means 

examining the physical character and features in 

the surrounding historic area including nearby 

historic properties on both sides of the street. 

A new construction design is successful when 

it incorporates a sufficient number of design 

variables that reference the historic context, while 

also containing some of the details that help 

define the neighboring historic buildings. The new 

construction project can also express the building’s 

current age by having a contemporary compatible 

design or by using a more traditional design 

language. For new non-residential buildings, 

context is the immediate surroundings of a project 

site (within a 360-degree view from the center of 

the parcel), and varies throughout each district. 

For example, in the Wilmore district the context of 

West Boulevard is very different than the context 

of West Park Avenue and West Kingston Avenue. 

West Boulevard in Wilmore also has a much 

different context than East Boulevard in Dilworth. 

Please refer to Chapter 3 for more information 

about contexts within each district. 

Therefore, the Charlotte Historic District 

Commission will not specify a particular 

architectural style or design for these new 

construction projects, but the criteria in this 

chapter are all important when considering whether 

a proposed new building design is appropriate, 

compatible and non-incongruous to the historic 

district and its context. 

In some cases, the zoning along the edges of some 

areas allows for more variety of building uses than 

found elsewhere in the district. The HDC does not 

have purview over building uses allowed by zoning; 

however, regardless of use, the design of new 

buildings needs to fit within the historic context. 

To minimize impacts on neighboring historic 

dwellings, the HDC will require scale-reducing 

techniques for all new infill construction. Designing 

these structures to minimize their impacts on 

neighboring historic dwellings is a challenging 

exercise. Scale-reducing techniques such as 

dividing the elevation elements into smaller bays, 

stepping back taller levels of the new building 

next to smaller historic structures, varying building 

planes, breaking up roof masses, using multiple 

materials, and taking clues from nearby historic 

buildings are essential to reducing the negative 

visual impacts of these larger structures on the 

historic districts. 

Dilworth Historic District 

Most of the non-residential buildings and zoning 

are on East Boulevard where a historically 

residential corridor has been converted into 

commercial uses. Thus, the existing context of this 

street has deeper setbacks and side yards than 

traditional historic commercial areas. (For more 

information on this type of new construction also 

see Chapter 6.) 

Some new commercial buildings of the past 

several decades were constructed before historic 

designations occurred and therefore, their design 

may not reflect references to the neighboring 

historic building and site context. 

Wilmore Historic District 

The Mint Street commercial corridor contains 

several types of historic commercial buildings 

including retail as well as factory-warehouse type 

buildings. 

Fourth Ward Historic District 

In this unique district, there are very different sub-

areas that include late-19th century frame historic 

dwellings and several nearby historic commercial 

buildings. Close by are much larger high-rise 

residential structures that are not historic due to 

their recent age. The context of the residential 

section does not allow much opportunity for new 

construction due to the lack of buildable lots. In the 

newer sections, the HDC only reviews the first three 

to five stories of any new building.

# 7

For Context: 

1. While new non-residential structures can take 

many design cues from existing historic buildings, 

respecting the immediate historic context of the 

new development is essential in terms of setback, 

spacing, height, scale, massing, roof forms, 

materials, foundation heights, window head 

heights, and cornice heights, etc. 

2. Where a site exists with a buildable area for a 

non-residential building, the immediate historic 

context takes priority and should be respected. 

3. Non-historic buildings within the historic district 

and in the area of the proposed new construction 

should not be considered as the design context 

for any new construction. 

4. In transition areas from single-family to denser 

development areas that by zoning allow more 

variety of uses, the historic context surrounding 

the site should be respected in terms of height, 

massing, roof forms, materials, modulated 

facades, etc. 

5. New buildings should respect historic lot lines 

and parcel sizes. Even if lots are combined into 

a single parcel as part of a rezoning, the new 

building’s scale, spacing, massing, rhythm, 

entrances, etc. should reflect the established 

historic development patterns. The mass of the 

building should be modulated with a material 

change and/or architectural change that creates a 

break in the wall plane to emulate the spacing of 

existing historic buildings.

STANDARDS 7 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR Non-REsidential BUILDINGS 7.4 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

SETBACK 

Setback is the distance between the building wall 

and the property line or right-of-way boundary 

at the front of the lot. The goal is to maintain 

a consistent setback on the block with new 

construction matching the existing historic context. 

For Setbacks: 

1. Relate the setback of any new construction and 

additions to the setback of the existing historic 

buildings in the immediate surroundings of the 

proposed new construction. 

2. Defer to the setback of the historic buildings for 

sites located between two distinctive areas of 

setback, such as between new non-residential and 

traditional residential uses. 

NOTE: Applicants should consult with HDC staff to 

determine if an individual property is in an area where 

the historic urban development pattern is being 

restored or where the Charlotte Zoning 

Ordinance may be in conflict with this guideline. 

Most commercial buildings in the historic districts have a minimal setback. 

Corridors like East Blvd. that have been converted from residential to commercial uses have deeper setbacks 

that should be retained in any new construction site. 

STANDARDS NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 7.5 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

# 7

SPACING 

Spacing refers to the side yard distances 

between buildings. 

For Spacing: 

1. Space new construction according to the historic 

pattern in the immediate surroundings of the 

proposed new construction. This includes sites 

adjacent to, as well as, across the street from the 

proposed new construction. 

Traditional historic commercial 

blocks have minimal to no spacing. 

Converted residential blocks should retain their 

residential spacing when building new infill structures. 

STANDARDS 7 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR Non-REsidential BUILDINGS 7.6 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

ORIENTATION 

Orientation refers to the direction in which the front 

of the building faces. 

STANDARDS 

For Orientation: 

1. Orient the front entrance of the new non-

residential construction to the street. 

2. Orient the primary elevation to the primary street 

and address the secondary side street if the 

non-residential building is to be constructed on a 

corner lot. 

New commercial construction should maintain the 

traditional facade orientation to the street. 

Likewise, any new commercial buildings on a converted 

residential street should ensure that their entrances are 

clearly designed to face the street. NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 7.7 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

# 7

MASSING AND COMPLEXITY OF FORM 

The overall massing of a building relates to the 

organization and relative size of the building 

sections or parts of a building in relationship to 

each other and other buildings on the street. A 

building’s form, or mass, can be simple (a box) 

or complex (a combination of many boxes or 

projections and indentations). 

STANDARDS 

For Massing and Form: 

1. Relate massing to those of existing adjacent 

historic buildings. For instance, if a street contains 

historic commercial buildings with simple massing 

do not introduce a new building with a complex 

massing. 

2. Use forms for new construction that relate to the 

forms of the majority of surrounding buildings. 

For instance, if the form of adjacent buildings has 

a variety of projecting bays, dormers, etc., employ 

some of these elements in the new building. 

3. Non-residential developments with more than 

one typical storefront width will need to employ 

techniques to break down overall length of the 

wall plane to appear as separate structures in 

order to have the new development fit the scale of 

the existing historic context. 

4. Roof forms such as hipped and gable roofs (if 

present in the surrounding historic context) help 

to break down the mass as do the complexity of 

form, architectural details, and materials. 

This proposed new building breaks up its facade mass into multiple bays with 

setbacks to better relate to the neighboring historic houses. 

This proposed new commercial building uses various mass reduction tools 

such as varying facade bays, roof forms, and setbacks to mitigate its impact 

on the historic character of the entire block. 

These two examples of the 

design of base levels of 

new high-rise buildings in 

Fourth Ward can use various 

techniques to break up the 

mass of a long structure 

while keeping a pedestrian 

oriented street presence. 

They include use of different 

materials, varying the facade 

bay planes, retaining window 

and door placement instead 

of blank walls, and creating 

cornice lines as well. The 

inclusion of balconies and 

planters are additional scale 

reduction elements. 7 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR Non-REsidential BUILDINGS 7.8 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

HEIGHT AND WIDTH 

The actual size of a new building can either 

contribute to, or be in conflict with, the historically 

significant structures in a historic district. Heights 

and width are two primary considerations for 

making new buildings fit within the context of a 

historic district. 

STANDARDS 

For Height and Width: 

1. The height and width of a new building should 

be compatible with historic buildings within a 

360-degree range of visibility from the center of 

the parcels. (See introduction to this chapter.) 

2. The height of a proposed building should be no 

taller than the tallest historic building on the block 

within a 360-degree range of visibility of the same 

type. The height of the historic structure should 

be calculated from the original historic ridge line, 

not any later additions that may be taller. 

3. Besides the overall height of the proposed 

new building, the foundation, window head, 

and cornice heights should also relate to the 

surrounding existing historic buildings. 

4. Design new buildings to respect the existing 

width of original structures in the district. 

5. On the commercial corridor of East Boulevard in 

the Dilworth Historic District, new construction 

should have similar height and width as the 

existing historic residential designed buildings 

since they help create the historic context. 

6. For new non-residential buildings that are 

located on the edge of a historic residential 

neighborhood, the height and width of the houses 

in the proximity of the site of the proposed new 

building should be respected. 

7. Height reduction techniques should be used such 

as stepped back elevations. 

8. The Fourth Ward Historic District already has 

a number of new, non-historic multi-family 

developments that range from town homes 

to multi-story apartment buildings. New 

non-residential, commercial, or mixed-use 

development in this district that is not in the 

context of the historic two-story residential 

types can have more flexibility in height and 

width. Note: When a tower element is included 

in the project design, then HDC reviews 

only the base elment of the project, which is 

typically the first 3-5 stories. 

Building heights on East Blvd. typically 11/2 to 2 stories and widths vary depending on the style and building type. 

Historic commercial buildings are typically 1 or 2 stories depending on age and use while their widths may vary as well, their storefront and facade bays are more 

consistent.

# 7

SCALE 

Scale in architecture is the relationship of the 

human form to the building. Heights and width are 

the beginnings of creating scale; however, other 

elements such as cornices, porches, windows, and 

storefronts etc. further define scale. Scale is also the 

relationship of the building to buildings around it. 

STANDARDS 

1. Create human scale by including functional 

elements of existing historic buildings typical to 

the surrounding context, such as porch forms or 

one-story projections along East Boulevard. 

2. On the Wilmore commercial corridor, the forms 

of the existing historic one-story buildings can 

be used to create human scale on the façade by 

incorporating storefronts in the new building 

similar to the large openings found in several of 

the existing industrial type designs. 

3. In Fourth Ward, the first three to five stories of 

new larger buildings should use scale- reduction 

techniques such as different foundation materials, 

façade bay divisions, cornice lines, wall plane 

differences between bays, as well as larger 

storefront and entry features to relate to the 

pedestrian scale. 

4. Care should be taken to design structures on 

the edges of the districts e.g. where residential 

streets meet corridors zoned for different uses. 

In these instances, the new building should use 

scale-reduction techniques (massing, stepped 

back side elevations, heights, roof forms, 

materials, fenestration, etc.) on elevations that 

face historic dwellings. 

Scale creating techniques on this design of a new commercial building include visually dividing each level, varying window patterns and 

facade materials, and creating storefronts at the pedestrian level. 

Regardless of residential styles, this row of dwellings on a commercial corridor all have scale reduction elements that should be 

included in a new nearby construction project. They include opening patterns, porches and porticos, varying materials, colors, and 

roof forms. 7 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR Non-REsidential BUILDINGS 7.10 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

DIRECTIONAL EXPRESSION 

The relationship of the height and width of the front 

elevation of a building mass provides its directional 

expression. A building may be horizontal, vertical, 

or square in its proportions. 

STANDARDS 

For Directional Expression: 

1. Make sure that the directional expression of new 

commercial buildings is compatible with that of 

surrounding historic properties. If the expression 

of a majority of the existing historic buildings 

is one type of expression, then the new design 

should relate to the proportions of that design. 

If there is more variety in the proportions of 

existing historic buildings in the surrounding 

context, the design of new dwelling may select 

from those options. 

Typically, a single-storefront commercial facade is vertical in directional expression, however, 

when several storefronts are included in a single facade, the overall directional expression 

becomes more horizontal. 

Most of the residential type commercial buildings are more horizontal in proportion in the 

historic districts. NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 7.11 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

# 7

FOUNDATIONS 

The foundation forms the base of the building. The 

design of new non-residential buildings should 

incorporate foundations for aesthetic as well as 

functional reasons. When built on a concrete slab 

without a visible foundation, new buildings may 

appear shorter and out of scale with surrounding 

historic buildings. 

STANDARDS 

For Foundations: 

1. Relate the height of a new foundation to the 

height of foundations on historic buildings found 

within the context of the new building. Avoid 

lowering the grade to achieve greater overall 

height to the new building. 

2. Relate the new foundation’s material treatment 

to that found on the surrounding context of the 

historic buildings. 

On taller buildings such as the those in Fourth Ward, the first floors often are detailed with a different material 

to visually act as a foundation for the building. 

Typically historic residential buildings are detailed with a different material, or a water table, to give the 

building a clear foundation definition. 7 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR Non-REsidential BUILDINGS 7.12 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

ROOF FORM AND MATERIALS 

The form of a roof is an important visual element 

in defining a non-residential building and helps 

create continuity and rhythm in the historic 

districts. Traditional, historic commercial buildings 

often have a sloped or flat roof form frequently 

hidden behind a parapet wall. In some cases, the 

commercial building may have a gable or hipped 

form, particularly if the existing commercial use is 

housed in what was once a residential dwelling. In 

these examples, the pitch and orientation of gables 

and hips are important aspects of roofs and there 

is a wide variety of applications of these particular 

features. Likewise, there are various designs for 

roof dormers that may correlate to the particular 

building style. 

For Roof Form and Materials: 

1. Use roof forms, such as sloped, flat, gable, or 

hipped, or combinations of forms in the design 

of new non-residential buildings that relate to 

existing surrounding historic examples. 

2. Consider employing roof dormers if they are 

commonly used in nearby historic houses that 

have been converted to commercial uses. 

3. Reflect the pitch and gable orientation of 

surrounding historic buildings in the design of a 

new non-residential building. 

4. Proportionally, the new roof should not 

overwhelm the structure or be out of scale for the 

style of the new design. 

5. Use eave design and materials that complement 

those frequently found in the historic context 

where the new building is being constructed. 

6. Match new roof materials with materials used in 

the context of the new building. 

7. Roof appurtenances such as solar panels, 

satellite dishes and mechanical equipment 

should be installed on secondary areas of the 

roof and/or screened by parapet walls or other 

design features. 

STANDARDS 

New commercial buildings should reference 

neighboring roof forms such as shown above. On residential corridors that have been converted to 

commercial uses, new construction should ensure that roof 

forms are compatible with neighboring historic houses. 

Taller non-residential/commercial/mixed-use buildings 

may have a variety of roof forms and elements to break 

down the scale of the large new building. NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 7.13 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

# 7

CORNICES AND TRIM 

Historic buildings in Charlotte’s historic districts 

have a variety of applications of cornices and 

decorative trim. These elements are used to 

define eave and cornice lines of roofs, articulate 

areas of openings and siding on walls, create 

porch elements, and define the edge of a wall 

and foundation. 

STANDARDS 

For Trim: 

1. Take cues from historic buildings in the 

surrounding existing context on the appropriate 

use of trim to articulate the design of a new 

building’s style and elements. 

2. Ensure that the proportion and scale of the trim 

relate to the scale and proportion of trim on 

historic buildings within the context of the new 

building. 

Horizontal cornice lines, string courses, and foundation water tables all 

are typical details that help create scale on facade designs. 

Contrasting vertical bay divisions, storefront cornice lines and horizontal banding 

above and below upper-story windows also are scale-reducing techniques. 

Designing new commercial buildings on a residential historic corridor should include cornice and trim details similar to existing examples. New construction should 

relate to first floor window and porch heights (1) as well as second floor window and cornice heights (2). Cornices and trim help to define these elements.

27 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR Non-REsidential BUILDINGS 7.14 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

STANDARDS 

For Doors and Windows: 

1. Relate window and door openings for new 

construction to the historic context in the 

following ways: 

a. the ratio of solids (walls) and voids (windows 

and doors); 

b. the rhythm and placement of window and 

door openings; 

c. the proportion of window and door openings, 

(the ratio of width to height); 

d. the general size of windows and doors. 

2. Respect the traditional design of openings. For 

instance, openings are generally recessed on a 

masonry building while the element is surrounded 

by raised trim on a frame building. New openings 

that are flush with the rest of the wall are not 

appropriate. 

3. Construct doors of wood (preferred material). 

Metal-clad, fiberglass, or metal doors may also 

be considered for new construction on a case-by-

case basis. 

DOORS AND WINDOWS 

The size, proportion, rhythms, pattern, and 

articulation of door and window openings help to 

give a building its individual style and character. 

The ratio of solid wall to voids created by openings 

also gives a building its particular style. There 

is a wide variety of style and character of these 

openings within buildings in the historic districts. 

Studying these elements of doors and windows 

of existing buildings, within the context of the 

proposed new design, will help better define what 

might be appropriate treatments for a 

new building. 

4. Use windows with true divided lights or interior 

and exterior fixed muntins with internal spacers to 

reference traditional designs and match the style 

of the building. Flat muntins, exterior removable 

grilles, and grills between glass are not allowed. 

The ratio of muntin to glass should be consistent 

with historic buildings in the context of the new 

construction and appropriate to the style. 

5. Do not use tinted or mirrored glass on major 

elevations of the building. Translucent or the 

clearest version of low-e glass may be approved. 

6. Use shutters of wood or a composite material 

without a faux wood grain (rather than metal or 

vinyl) scaled to fit the window opening. Shutters 

should be mounted on hinges. Do not use 

shutters on bay, double, or composite windows. 

Traditional patterns of fenestration (window/door openings) help define historic residential styles and 

should be incorporated on new building designs on commercial corridors. 

Historic commercial buildings generally have patterns of storefront openings as well as 

windows on upper stories. 

Doors and window reduce the scale of larger buildings. NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 7.15 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

# 7

STANDARDS 

For Storefronts: 

1. When designing new storefronts or elements of 

storefronts, conform to the configuration and 

materials of traditional storefronts. 

2. Keep the ground levels of new retail commercial 

buildings at least 60 percent transparent up to a 

level of 10 feet if possible. 

3. Articulate the entrance bay of larger institutional 

or office buildings to provide visual interest. 

4. Include doors in all storefronts to reinforce 

street-level vitality. Discourage “mini-malls” with 

one central door to the interior unless individual 

storefronts also have usable entrances and 

display windows. 

5. Neighborhood transitional buildings, in general, 

should not have transparent first floors that 

face residential areas, and the design and size 

of their facade openings should relate more to 

neighboring residential structures. 

6. Institutional buildings generally would not 

have storefronts, but their street levels should 

provide visual interest and display space could be 

integrated into the design. 

7. New construction in commercial areas with 

a predominately residential building design 

(ex. East Boulevard) should follow existing 

context and architectural language by 

including front porches. 

STOREFRONTS 

In the commercial areas of some historic districts, 

most of the buildings have a storefront due to their 

commercial nature. In the other areas, some of 

the buildings do not have storefronts due to their 

original residential design but still have windows or 

porches at street level. 

Storefronts are a common element on historic 

commercial buildings although some industrial 

or warehouse types may not have them. Multiple 

storefronts are included in wider buildings to 

provide for multiple tenants and provide a scale 

reduction design element to break up long 

facades into smaller bays. 

Most recent storefronts in new buildings typically use more contemporary designs 

and materials such as simple metal frames and plain bulkheads. 7 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR Non-REsidential BUILDINGS 7.16 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

MATERIALS 

There is a rich variety of materials used to 

construct the historic buildings in the historic 

districts including wood for trim, siding, and 

wall shingles, brick for foundations and walls, 

stone for foundations and porch piers, and 

stucco for walls. The variety of these materials 

helps to give the districts rich character. 

See Chapter 5: Building Materials for more 

information on materials found in Charlotte’s 

Local Historic Districts. 

In recent years, the building industry has 

developed various substitute materials that have a 

similar appearance to several of these traditional, 

historic materials. For various reasons including 

cost, maintenance, and quality of available 

original materials, substitute materials are being 

used as alternatives to traditional materials in 

historic districts, particularly for compatible new 

construction. 

For Materials: 

1. Use compatible traditional materials such as brick, 

stucco, stone, and wood. Avoid split-faced block, 

and any material, color, size, scale or texture that 

is in stark contrast to the historic context. 

2. If a wood appearance is appropriate within 

the design of a new non-residential building, 

non-grained cementitious siding that matches 

the traditional dimension of wood siding may 

be permitted. Also, smooth cementitious or 

composite siding that matches the traditional 

dimension of wood siding is permitted for 

new accessory buildings. Additions to historic 

structures using non-traditional materials will be 

evaluated on a case-by- case basis. 

3. Vinyl and PVC windows and doors, unpainted 

aluminum panels or display framing, reflective 

or tinted glass display windows, particle 

board/engineered wood, T1-11, vinyl or 

aluminum siding, EFIS (artificial stucco), plastic 

shutters, inoperable shutters, or shutters on 

windows where they never previously existed 

are not allowed on either existing buildings or 

any portion of new construction in the historic 

districts. 

4. While wood and metal are the first choice for 

elements such as trim, storefront elements, 

and other decorative features, substitute 

materials may be considered for trim details on 

new construction. 

Brick (above) and terra cotta (below) are the primary wall 

materials on these historic commercial buildings. Wood 

is generally found as trim. 

Painted or unpainted brick is the most common 

material used in existing historic commercial 

buildings. 

STANDARDS NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 7.17 CHARLOTTE H ISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

# 7

ADDITIONS 

Additions to the existing historic commercial 

structures in Charlotte’s Local Historic Districts 

should complement the original structure. They 

should reflect the design, scale, materials, and 

architectural style of the original building. At the 

same time, a carefully designed new addition may 

respect the original without totally copying the 

historic design features. 

The design of new additions should follow 

the Standards for new construction on the 

preceding pages for all elevations. 

If the building owner intends to take advantage 

of the available North Carolina historic tax credits 

for the rehabilitation of the existing historic 

buildings, the design of any new addition will 

require design review at the state level. While 

these Standards follow the intent of the Secretary 

of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation 

Projects, interpretation of the Standards by the 

State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) review 

staff may differ from these Standards. 

For Additions to Buildings: 

1. Attempt to locate the addition on the rear 

elevation so that it is minimally visible from 

the street. 

2. Limit the size of the addition so that it does not 

visually overpower the existing historic building. 

3. Attempt to attach new additions or alterations to 

existing buildings in such a manner that, if such 

additions or alterations were to be removed in 

the future, the essential form and integrity of the 

building would be unimpaired. 

4. Maintain the original orientation of the structure. 

If the primary entrance is located on the street 

facade, it should remain in that location. 

5. Maintain the existing roof pitch. Roof lines for 

new additions should be secondary to those of 

the existing structure. Typically, the original roof 

as visible from the public right-of-way should not 

be raised. 

There are various ways to add on to a historic residentially styled 

building as these examples show (above). Often new commercial 

uses on corridors may require more space and, depending on other 

site features such as rear parking, may require new entrances. 

If the site allows, rear additions are feasible for historic commercial-style buildings 

by using similar roof height and slope as shown above. 

6. Make sure that the design of a new addition 

is compatible with the existing building. The 

new work should be differentiated from the old 

while being compatible with its massing, form, 

scale, directional expression, roof forms, and 

materials, foundation, fenestration, and materials. 

The style of the addition may range from a 

contemporary compatible design to a more 

traditional aesthetic expression. 

7. Additions that are no taller nor wider than the 

existing building and increase the building’s 

square footage 50% or less are typically eligible 

for administrative approval.

# STANDARDS FOR PRIVATE SITES 88.1 

Site design is the relationship between 

a building and its site features, such as 

landscaping, outbuildings, and other 

elements within the property boundary. 

These site features help define the 

character of the property and may be 

considered an important part of any project 

in Charlotte’s Local Historic Districts. These 

Standards apply to historic properties and 

new construction. 

As you plan your project you should 

consult the Zoning Ordinance for detailed 

requirements on many of the site features 

discussed in this chapter. Note that all 

new construction projects are required to 

submit a complete site plan, including a 

landscape plan, to the Charlotte Historic 

District Commission for approval. 

The HDC recognizes that garden and 

yard design is easily changed, often with 

little impact on the overall character of a 

historic district. Consequently, the following 

Standards address major landscape 

elements and do not apply to minor 

features such as planting shrubs or flower 

beds.

SIDEWALKS AND PARKING 

These Standards are intended to ensure that 

both residential and non-residential parking plans 

have a minimum impact on the historic character 

of the area. 

A driveway frequently leads to the rear of a lot 

where it may terminate at a parking area, a garage 

or a shed. 

For Residential Projects: 

1. Retain existing historic walkways. 

2. Walks and walkways in front and side yards, 

or those that are substantially visible from 

the street in new construction, should follow 

the historic design patterns of the 

surrounding environment. 

3. Retain existing historic driveways. 

4. Driveways made of twin parallel paved strips 

are considered important historic features and 

should be maintained where possible. This 

type of driveway design should be used in new 

construction where appropriate. 

5. For new construction, provide driveways to the 

side of the new building. New driveways should 

be as narrow as possible. Historic driveways are 8’ 

in width. 

6. Do not place paved areas for parking in the 

front yard. In smaller-scale residential parcels, 

driveways that stop at the original building façade 

are viewed as front yard parking pads, and thus 

are prohibited. All driveways for residential uses 

should extend to at least the rear building line. 

7. Repair damaged areas with materials that 

match the original paving in color, size, texture, 

and finish. Ensure any new paving material is 

compatible with the character of the context of 

the project. Asphalt paving is not allowed for 

sidewalks, curb cuts, driveways, and aprons. 

8. Do not pave up to the foundation. A planting 

strip approximately 12”-24” wide should be left 

between the drive and house. 

It is difficult to accommodate broad expanses of 

concrete parking pads within smaller residential parcels. 

It is challenging to create parking areas within small lots 

but ribbon driveways that lead to side or rear parking 

help minimize the impact on the front lawn. 

This diagram illustrates recommended parking (left), and 

prohibited parking (right). See Standard 6. 

Recommended Prohibited 

STANDARDS GUIDELINES FOR PRIVATE SITES 88.3 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

Other: 

9. Parking should be located to the side or rear of 

the property if at all possible. Front parking is 

allowed only when it is an established practice in 

commercial corridors, and when such a parking 

scheme would not otherwise violate the historic 

character of a particular streetscape. When 

allowed, such parking areas must be buffered from 

the sidewalk. Any parking or paving plan must 

include a screening plan to buffer non-residential 

parking areas from adjacent residential uses. 

10. Parking beyond that required by local ordinance 

will be considered if the area is landscaped and 

relates to the streetscape in an appropriate 

manner. 

11. Parking must be screened in some manner so that 

the parking is not the dominant feature of the 

property. 

12. Any parking structures must meet the 

requirements of new construction for historic 

districts. 

13. Curb cuts to parking areas should be limited 

to two lanes and not extend beyond minimum 

required widths. 

The site of a typical Mid-Century home generally has an open and flat front lawn with 

minimal landscaping except for foundations plantings around the house. Note the 

front walk does not extend to the street but ties into the paved driveway. 

Existing dwellings 

converted to commercial 

uses or new commercial 

infill buildings inserted into 

residential corridors should 

incorporate additional 

parking needs in the rear of 

the lot in order to maintain 

the front lawns of the site. 

The example on the left is a 

new commercial building on 

East Boulevard with parking 

access under the left side of 

the building. These layouts illustrate how parking areas can be added to residential conversions. 8 GUIDELINES FOR PRIVATE SITES 8.4 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

LANDSCAPING AND LAWNS 

Like the placement of a structure on its site, the 

character of the landscape and accompanying 

plantings contribute to the identity of the historic 

district. Charlotte’s Local Historic Districts have a 

rich landscape quality that gives them a distinctive 

character including large shade trees and well-

kept yards with a variety of plantings. (For more 

information on Trees, see the following section). 

For Landscaping and Yards: 

1. Historic site features are considered integral parts 

of historic properties and cannot be removed 

without approval. 

2. Retain existing trees and plantings that help define 

the district’s character. 

3. Replace diseased or dead plants and trees to 

match the plant to be replaced or with indigenous 

species (refer to the Charlotte Land Development 

Standards Manual for Approved Plant Species). 

4. Repeat the dominant landscape design (plant, size, 

and species) found in the historic district when 

installing new plantings. 

5. In residential uses, setbacks must be clear of 

plantings and structures that obstruct the view of 

the main building on a property. 

6. Do not replace grass in front yards with paving, 

gravel, or other non-traditional materials. 

7. In a single-family use, no more than 50% of the 

rear yard (as measured from the back of the 

original house) shall be of impermeable material 

including the roofs of additions to original 

buildings, paving, decks, patios, pools, and 

accessory buildings. Wood slatted decks are 

considered permeable. 

8. For decks not visible from the street, composite 

decking materials are allowed on horizontal 

surfaces only. 

9. Certain modern materials for landscape and site 

features are not allowed including: 

a. Interlocking concrete blocks with beveled 

edges 

b. Bare concrete block 

c. Treated landscaping timbers 

d. Railroad ties 

e. Pre-fabricated lattice 

10. Use hardscape materials that complement the 

historic structure and property. Bluestone may be 

used in areas not visible from the street. 

Retain historic site features whenever possible such as 

the original rolled concrete curb pictured above. 

Foundation plantings help anchor this house to 

its surroundings. 

Do not use 

interlocking 

concrete block 

with beveled 

edges, such as 

the example 

shown left, for 

landscape and 

site features. 

An occasional large tree or shrub can be found in the 

front lawns of Oaklawn Park, but most such areas are 

planted with only grass. 

STANDARDS GUIDELINES FOR PRIVATE SITES 88.5 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

TREES 

Large canopy trees are a major character-defining 

feature in most of the streets in Charlotte’s 

historic districts. For this reason, review of the 

care and treatment of this feature is an important 

component of these Standards. The Charlotte Land 

Development Standards Manual (CLDSM) contains 

a table of Approved Plant Species which should be 

referenced when undertaking any project that may 

require tree removal and replanting. 

For Trees: 

1. Retain existing trees that define the 

district’s character. 

2. When tree removal is needed (due to disease, 

documented damage to a historic structure, 

or other reasons) or desired, a Certified 

Arborist must be consulted and the written 

recommendation must be provided to the HDC 

before removal may be granted. This standard 

includes trees in front, side, and rear yards. Staff 

may approve removal of diseased or declining 

trees based on the Certified Arborist letter. 

Several streets in the historic 

districts have landscaped medians 

and verges between sidewalks and 

streets that are important areas for 

creating canopies of street trees. 

Many of the historic districts’ streets are characterized 

by large, mature street trees that are essential in defining 

the public streetscape areas. 

STANDARDS 

3. Trees less than ten (10) inches in diameter may 

be removed in front, side, and rear yards with 

Administrative approval. 

4. Identify and take care to protect significant 

existing trees and other plantings via a Tree 

Protection Plan when constructing new buildings, 

additions, or accessory structures such as garages. 

5. New construction that impacts healthy trees must 

be reviewed by the HDC. Mature trees that are 

unhealthy or causing significant structural damage 

to historic structures may reviewed by HDC staff. 

Replacement trees may be required. 

6. The HDC may require the planting of additional 

trees to replace a mature canopy that is removed. 

7. Requests to remove a Heritage Tree as defined by 

the Unified Development Ordinance, Article 20.14, 

are not subject to HDC Review. 8 GUIDELINES FOR PRIVATE SITES 8.6 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

FENCES AND WALLS 

Fencing along the front of properties in the 

Charlotte historic districts is not a common 

occurrence. There is the occasional exception of 

a picket fence or decorative iron fence. In some 

areas, small retaining walls are used to define the 

edge of a front lawn from the adjoining sidewalk. 

Landscape hedges are also used to create side 

yard edges between narrow lots. 

The lack of front yard fencing helps to create 

the broad landscape feel of the streets in the 

districts and allows the focus to be on the large 

canopy of trees and the historic houses nestled 

into the landscape. 

Adding fencing around a front lawn where fencing 

never existed, in general, is discouraged; however, 

it will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 

Front yard fencing and/or walls are not allowed in 

Oaklawn Park. Many houses have rear yard fencing 

which is allowed. 

a balance of solid and void and cannot be solid 

fencing. Front yard fencing must enclose three 

sides of the front yard. Front yard privacy fences, 

solid privacy fences, and unpainted or unstained 

wood fences are not allowed. 

5. The style, scale, and detail of a new fence should 

reflect the style and period of the house and/ 

or the street on which the house is located. In 

general, fence materials should relate to the 

original materials used on similar fences of the 

period. Chain link, vinyl, split rail fences, and bare 

concrete block walls are not allowed. An exception 

may be found in Oaklawn Park where chain link 

fences in rear yards are often the original fence 

type and material. These fences are typically a 

maximum of 3-4 feet in height, in rear yards only 

and are see-through. 

6. The structural members of any fence must face 

inward to the property being fenced. Fences

Maintain historic grading and elevations within 

public view. 

2. Repair existing historic fences and walls by 

salvaging original parts or materials for a 

prominent location from a less prominent location, 

when possible. 

3. For original, historic retaining walls: replace 

existing historic fences and walls by matching the 

material, height, and detail. If this is not possible, 

use a simplified design of similar materials and 

height. 

4. New fencing, if appropriate, should not exceed 

the average height of other fences and walls of 

surrounding properties with the height of the 

new fence or wall. In general, for fences facing 

the street in the front yard, the height of the 

support posts should not exceed thirty-six inches 

above grade and the height of the pickets should 

not exceed thirty inches. Front fencing must be

7. Fencing should be wood or dark metal. No vinyl, 

composite or PVC materials may be used. Wooden 

fences must be painted or stained to complement 

the historic character of the street and house. 

8. Rear fencing and walls may be a maximum of six 

feet in height, as measured from the outside at 

grade. Fencing that continues past the rear corner 

of the house down the side yard, must step down 

to five feet in height to approximately mid-way 

along the building. At the mid-way point, fencing/ 

walls need to step down to four feet in height and 

my tie in at the front corner of the house at four 

feet in height. 

9. Fencing and walls must avoid any style that 

presents a long unbroken expanse. This includes 

stockade-style fencing that does not have a 

minimum two-inch spacing between the pickets. 

Fences with horizontally-oriented rails should 

be of a design that incorporates vertical trim or 

structural members to break up long expanses. 

10. A planting strip of 18” (minimum) to 24” 

(preferred) between fences/walls and public 

rights-of-way is required. On corner lots, privacy 

fences in rear yards must be screened on the 

public side of the fence. 

11. Any new retaining wall should be a true retaining 

wall, not a decorative feature, and be no taller than 

necessary to function. 

12. New retaining walls may be brick, mortared stone 

(as shown on page 8.6), or smooth-coat stucco 

finish. Certain modern materials for retaining walls 

are not allowed including: 

a. Interlocking concrete blocks with beveled 

edges 

b. Bare concrete block 

c. thin stacked stone, except for mid-century 

properties. 

Fences should stepdown along the side yard. 8 GUIDELINES FOR PRIVATE SITES 8.8 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

> PICKET - PLAIN

A solid privacy fence is not allowed in the historic districts 

Fences need to have spaces between pickets and the length broken by posts such as these examples. 

Fences should be landscaped on public elevations. 

Traditionally scaled and detailed fences 

may be used in front lawns depending 

on the historic context. GUIDELINES FOR PRIVATE SITES 88.9 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

SITE APPURTENANCES 

Site appurtenances, such as overhead wires, fuel 

tanks, utility poles and meters, antennae, satellite 

dishes, exterior mechanical units, and trash 

containers are a necessary part of contemporary 

life. 

The placement of these items can either have a 

neutral impact on the character of the site and 

structure or detract from its appearance. 

Site features fall into two categories; those features 

that can be controlled by the property owner – 

antennae, satellite dishes, solar panels, electric 

vehicle charging units, mechanical units, trash 

containers, etc.; and those that cannot – overhead 

wires, utility poles, etc. 

For the purpose of historic districts, the front yard 

is defined as the area from the front thermal wall(s) 

to the public right-of-way. 

STANDARDS 

For Site Appurtenances: 

1. Place site appurtenances in inconspicuous areas 

to the rear of the building or in side yards and 

screen with appropriate plantings or fencing. Site 

appurtenances are not allowed in the front yard. 

2. Place above-ground backflow preventers in 

locations that are not substantially visible from a 

street. 

3. Antennae and satellite dishes can be located on 

rooftop locations not visible from the public right-

of-way. 

4. Store trash containers and dumpsters in screened 

locations not visible from public rights-of-way. 

5. Dumpsters in Local Historic Districts must be 

screened. 

These site appurtenances are located in areas behind 

fences and screened from public view. 

This trash container enclosure is designed as part of a 

rear porch.

ACCESSORY BUILDINGS 

Although the main dwelling on a site makes 

the strongest statement about a property’s 

contribution to the character of a Local Historic 

District, accessory buildings, such as garages and 

storage sheds can also have a significant impact on 

the historic character of the district. Many of the 

homes in the districts have garages set to the rear 

of the house and do not detract from the site. 

STANDARDS 

For Accessory Buildings: 

1. Retain and repair historic outbuildings. Applications 

for the demolition of dilapidated accessory 

structures may be eligible for administrative 

approval. 

2. Place new outbuildings, such as garages or 

sheds, to the rear of lots that are large enough 

to accommodate them following the applicable 

zoning requirements. Typically, new outbuildings 

cannot be located in front or side yards except in 

the Oaklawn Historic District where small open 

carports are typically located on the side of the 

house. Garages that are a part of multi-family and 

in a residential context cannot be located on the 

front elevation of the building. 

3. Design new outbuildings to be compatible with the 

style and character of the primary historic building 

on the site, especially in scale, massing, and other 

architectural elements. Any new outbuilding must 

be clearly secondary (height, footprint, scale, 

massing) to the main structure on the site. 

4. Vinyl doors are considered to be inappropriate 

materials for outbuildings and are not permitted. 

For more information on appropriate new 

construction see Chapter 6. 

5. Prefabricated outbuildings that are not in keeping 

with the historic character of the district are not 

allowed where visible from the public street. 

6. Garage doors shall either be authentically 

separate, single bay doors or designed to give 

the appearance of separate doors rather than one 

long continuous panel on traditionally designed 

accessory structures. 

7. Larger outbuildings such as garages and Accessory 

Dwelling Units (ADUs) not located on corner lots 

that are a maximum of 24’ in height and/or a 

minimum 2’ shorter than the primary structure, 

as measured from grade to ridge, and that meet 

all other design requirements may be eligible for 

Administrative approval.

In Oaklawn Park small character-defining carports still 

remain on some parcels. Note the decorative cast metal 

supports on this example with its flat sloping roof. GUIDELINES FOR PRIVATE SITES 88.11 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

ACCESS RAMPS 

Access ramps are sometimes a necessity for 

residents of an older house that does not have 

an at-grade entrance. These ramps can often be 

added to existing homes in a manner that relates 

well to a historic building and without substantially 

altering significant features. 

STANDARDS 

For Access Ramps: 

1. Locate access ramps at a well-defined entrance 

to the building and where providing that access 

will not cause permanent damage to character-

defining features of the building. The ideal 

approach is to place access ramps or other 

structures to the side or rear of the building. If 

site conditions preclude this option, a ramp on the 

front elevation should be sensitive to the character 

and materials of the existing building. Designs 

should be unobtrusive, simple, and meet slope 

requirements for such elements. 

2. Ensure that any solution is reversible; that it may 

be built, used, and removed without permanent 

damage to the historic features of the building. 

Retain and preserve historic elements, such as 

porch railings, so that these original features 

may be restored to the structure when a ramp 

is removed. 

3. Landscaped screening, the careful choice of 

building materials, and compatible color choices 

are all suggested ways of lessening the visual 

impact of access ramp structures. 

4. In lieu of a ramp, mechanical lifts or other devices 

can be used as a less intrusive alternative or if 

space limitations do not allow a ramp. 

This entry ramp is conveniently placed to lead from the side driveway to a 

nearby secondary entrance to the house. 8 GUIDELINES FOR PRIVATE SITES 8.12 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

LIGHTING 

Lighting of residential properties generally 

includes exterior lights on houses, minimal lights 

on walkways and in garden areas, and utilitarian 

lighting at accessory buildings. 

STANDARDS 

For Lighting: 

1. Retain any historic light fixtures on the site 

and house. 

2. Repair and refurbish historic light fixtures 

when possible. 

3. Replace a historic light fixture only when parts for 

the existing fixture can no longer be found 

or replicated. 

4. Use fixtures that are compatible with the character 

of the historic building and the surrounding area. 

5. Choose light levels that provide for adequate 

safety but do not overly emphasize the residential 

site or building. Often, existing porch lights may 

be sufficient. 

6. Avoid bright security lighting mounted at eave 

heights of buildings. Any security lighting must be 

downward directed. 

7. Temperature of any new lighting will not exceed 

300 lumens. 

8. In general, new lighting should be dark sky 

compliant, downward directed, and fully shielded. 

This brick retaining wall defines the edge of the steps 

and provides an unusual location for a site light fixture. 

In other instances, a pole mounted fixture would provide 

illumination for the steps. 

The street lights in the Fourth Ward Local Historic 

District are compatible with district character and are 

important elements of the streetscape. GUIDELINES FOR PRIVATE SITES 88.13 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS

# DEMOLITION AND RELOCATION OF HISTORIC STRUCTURES 99.1 

Historic buildings are irreplaceable community assets. Once they are gone, they are 

gone forever. With each successive demolition, the integrity of the affected district 

is further eroded. Therefore, the demolition or moving of any building in a historic 

district should be considered very carefully before approval is given. The loss of even 

one building creates a noticeable gap in the historic fabric of the historic district. 9 DEMOLITION AND rELOCATION OF HISTORIC STRUCTURES 9.2 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

DEMOLITION 

North Carolina Law (N.C.G.S. 160D-949.) states 

that the demolition of buildings and structures 

within Local Historic Districts requires the prior 

issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness. The 

policies listed below are designed to follow state 

law in a manner that minimizes the inconvenience 

to property owners when demolition is warranted, 

while affording as much protection as possible to 

structures and sites that have special significance or 

value toward maintaining the character of the Local 

Historic Districts. 

Any project that the Historic District Commission 

determines would require significant and substan -

tial exterior demolition may, at the discretion of 

the Commission, be subject to the HDC policy on 

Demolition. 

STANDARDS 

For Demolition: 

1. No building or structure located within a Local 

Historic District can be demolished without a 

Certificate of Appropriateness. 

2. The Historic District Commission will evaluate 

demolition applications to determine if the 

structure or site in question has special 

significance or value toward maintaining the 

character of the Local Historic District. If the 

HDC finds that the structure or site has no special 

significance or value toward maintaining the 

character of the district or is unsalvageable, it 

shall waive all or part of such period and authorize 

earlier demolition or removal. 

3. Should the Historic District Commission find that 

the structure does have special significance or 

value toward maintaining the character of the 

Local Historic District, the HDC may delay the 

issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness 

authorizing demolition for a period not to exceed 

365 days in order to work with the owner to seek 

alternatives to demolition. 

4. When an application for demolition receives a 365-

day delay, any consideration of applications for 

proposed new construction on the same site will 

be deferred for 90 days. 

5. When an application for demolition receives a 365-

day delay, the Historic District Commission Staff 

will contact, within one month of the delay vote, the 

property owner who has applied for demolition to 

encourage them to seek alternatives to demolition. 

HDC Staff will also notify partner preservation 

organizations, such as Preservation North Carolina, 

Preserve Mecklenburg Inc. and the Charlotte-

Mecklenburg Historic Landmarks Commission 

to inform them of the threatened status of the 

building. 

6. If the building cannot be retained, then it should 

be documented thoroughly with photographs of 

all sides of the building; sketch plans; notations 

of height, width, and setback; and, if possible, 

measured drawings. 

7. Maintain any empty lot appropriately so that it is 

free of hazards and trash and is well tended if the 

site is to remain vacant for any length of time. 

8. Salvage significant materials such as wood 

flooring, doors, windows, brick and stone, trim, 

and decorative features for subsequent reuse. 

9. A permanent injunction against demolition 

can be invoked only in cases where a building 

or structure is certified by the State Historic 

Preservation Officer as being of statewide 

significance. 

10. Applications for the demolition of dilapidated 

accessory structures may be eligible for 

administrative approval. All other demolition 

applications will be reviewed by the full 

Commission. DEMOLITION AND RELOCATION OF HISTORIC STRUCTURES 99.3 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

MOVING 

The moving of any building from its original site 

should be avoided if at all possible. Once a build -

ing has been moved from its original site, it loses its 

association with the site, and thus loses its place 

in time. 

Moving a building should be considered only after 

it is determined that, should it remain at its original 

site, it would meet sure demolition. All other 

avenues should be explored if the purpose is the 

preservation of the structure. If there is no other 

option to save a building from demolition, careful 

plans should be undertaken to find a suitable site 

for the structure. 

The first choice for relocation should be a vacant 

site within the same historic district that shares the 

character of the site from which the building is to 

be moved. Such a site will allow the building to 

continue to contribute to the character of the dis -

trict and help to ensure compatibility with existing 

structures. If the building must be moved outside 

of the historic district, a site should be chosen with 

preference to its historic character as well. 

STANDARDS 

For Moving: 

1. Move buildings only after all alternatives to 

retention have been examined. 

2. Photograph the building and the site thoroughly, 

and also, measure the building if the move will 

require substantial reconstruction. 

3. Undertake a professional structural assessment of 

the building’s condition in order to minimize any 

damage that might occur during the move. 

4. Select a contractor who has experience in moving 

buildings and check references with other building 

owners who have used this contractor. 

5. Secure the building from vandalism and potential 

weather damage before and after its move. 

6. Improve the empty lot in a manner consistent with 

other open space in the historic district if the site 

is to remain vacant for any length of time. 9 DEMOLITION AND rELOCATION OF HISTORIC STRUCTURES 9.4 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

> This Page Intentionally Left Blank

4. Sensitively designed supports may, if 

approved, exceed the square footage 

restrictions listed below, but not the 

height restrictions. 

5. Incidental signage, such as parking and 

entrance signs, require approval by the HDC 

or its Staff. 

6. The HDC reserves the right to approve the 

placement of all signs on properties within 

Local Historic Districts. 

7. The HDC will not exercise control over logos 

or color. It is strongly recommended that color 

schemes relate to the building the sign serves. 

8. Property addresses should be clearly 

displayed either on the sign or on the 

building itself. 

9. No off premise signs will be approved. 

10. Signs may be lit with unobtrusive ground-

mounted spotlights or other unobtrusive 

lighting as the HDC may approve. Signs may 

not flash, blink, or glow from within. 

11. Neon signs are permitted. Neon signs 

mounted inside windows can be installed 

without HDC approval, as long as they comply 

with the City of Charlotte Sign Ordinance. 

12. Real estate signs will not require prior HDC 

approval, but should meet the other provisions 

of these regulations. 

13. All multi-tenant building signage must be 

consolidated, may not exceed one sign per 

street frontage, and are limited to a total of 10 

square feet in area total inclusive of all tenants. 

14. Roof signs are prohibited. 

The Charlotte Historic District Commission 

recognizes that signage is necessary within Local 

Historic Districts. However, like other elements 

under the Commission’s jurisdiction, there is a 

responsibility to ensure that such signage respects 

the character of the Local Historic District where 

it is erected. The Commission strives to maintain 

signage policies that compromise neither the 

design qualities of the Local Historic District nor 

the ability of individual businesses to be successful. 

The Commission acknowledges the need to give 

signage applications careful consideration in order 

to avoid placing historic district businesses at a 

disadvantage. At the same time, business owners 

within the districts must realize that they have 

chosen to locate within some of the most attractive 

and sensitive areas of Charlotte, and that the City 

has a proven interest in maintaining certain design 

standards in these areas. Indeed, these locations 

alone can be a competitive advantage to many 

businesses. 

The following provisions apply to all signs within 

Local Historic Districts. Where these regulations 

conflict with the City of Charlotte Sign Ordinance, 

the more restrictive provision will apply. 

1. All signs within Local Historic Districts will 

require a Certificate of Appropriateness. 

2. All signs should be primarily for identification 

purposes. 

3. All signs must visually relate to the building 

they serve. Only suitable materials, such as 

stone, wood, brick, and sturdy metals, will 

be approved. 

# APPENDIX A - SIGN STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS 

A.1 A.2 CHARLOTTE HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS 

APPENDIX A - SIGN STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS 

3. Signs should not exceed six feet in height or 

ten square feet in area. 

4. Only one and two sided signs will be allowed. 

5. In most circumstances, only one sign per 

property will be allowed. Businesses located 

on corner lots may request one sign per street 

frontage, but one frontage must be designated 

as secondary. On the secondary frontage, only 

one sign will be allowed, and that sign shall not 

exceed 1.5 square feet in area or three feet in 

height. 

Within Industrial Zoning Districts: 

1. No sign may exceed six feet in height or twelve 

square feet in area. 

Multi-Tenant Business Properties Within All 

Zoning Districts: 

1. Multi-tenant business properties are only 

allowed one sign per street frontage, under 

the provisions of the City of Charlotte Sign 

Ordinance. Therefore, applications for signage 

for such properties must be coordinated by the 

owner of the property or their agent. The HDC 

will under no circumstances mediate a dispute 

between tenants regarding signage allotments. 

2. Signs should not exceed ten square feet in area 

per side or six feet in height. For non-residential 

multi-tenant properties, the HDC will consider 

designs that exceed the area restrictions by no 

more than 25%. The height restrictions cannot 

be exceeded. 

Any departures from signage plans for which 

a Certificate of Appropriateness has been 

issued must be approved in advance by the 

HDC. Failure to seek such prior approval will 

constitute a violation of the Charlotte Historic 

District Ordinance. 

Allowable signage size and height for Local 

Historic District properties will be determined 

by each property’s current land use zoning, as 

outlined below. 

Within Residential Zoning Districts: 

1. For buildings primarily in a residential use, no 

sign shall exceed 1.5 square feet per side. For 

buildings primarily in allowable business uses, 

no sign shall exceed six square feet per side. 

2. No sign shall exceed four feet in height. 

3. Only one sign per property will be allowed. 

4. Only one and two sided signs will be allowed. 

5. Certain permitted non-residential uses, such as 

religious structures, schools and museums, may 

apply for larger signs, which shall be granted at 

the discretion of the HDC. 

Within Urban Districts, General Commercial, and 

Research/Office Zoning Districts: 

1. All single family residential uses must adhere 

to the Residential Zoning Signage Regulations 

listed above. 

2. Signs attached to buildings: If a sign has a 

projection of six inches or less, it may be up 

to eight square feet in area. If the projection 

exceeds six inches, the sign may be no more 

than six square feet in area. 

Planned Multi-Family Developments in All 

Zoning Districts: 

1. Planned multi-family developments must 

submit a unified signage plan to the HDC for 

approval. No plans will be approved that do not 

follow the general intent of these regulations. 

The main sign for such developments must 

recognize the zoning district in which the 

development lies. 

Non-Conforming Signs: 

1. Existing non-conforming signs shall be brought 

into compliance with these regulations upon 

any signage change request, unless the sign 

is documented as being a ‘historic sign’ in 

accordance with the definition set forth in the 

Sign Ordinance. 

Historic Signs: 

1. The restoration and retention of historic signs 

and/or historic sign structural elements that 

remain in their original location is encouraged. APPENDIX B - HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION GLOSSARY
